# Honoring App Raters

We would like to take this time to honor the work of app raters, without whom this database would not be in existence. 

The development and maintenance of the MHealth Index and Navigation Database (MIND) is supported by a dedicated team of app raters -- a group of students, researchers, professionals, and app users hailing from all over the world. MIND is unique in its transparency and objectivity: any interested rater can undergo an extensive online training and ultimately contribute new apps and app updates to the database.

The following raters represent a team of app raters from Stellenbosch University in Stellenbosch, South Africa. Over the course of 2020, these raters volunteered their time and expertise to contribute numerous app ratings to MIND.
