The vision board serves as a collage of your dreams and goals in the form of photos, quotes, and affirmations.\n\nIn the Gratitude app, we’ll help you make a great vision board using sections, goal ideas, and create a video of all your goals together with music. You can also make multiple vision boards!\n\n4. 🌈DAILY ZEN\n\nWe understand the need for motivation and inspiration as you build a healthy routine with these self-help tools, which is why Daily Zen is an important part of the app. \n\nHere, you will find gratitude quotes, motivation quotes, thought switch ideas, thank you cards, affirmations, blog articles, and real-life stories of people who changed their mindset with gratitude.\n\nOne simple switch can begin a massive change in your life. A self-care tool like Gratitude will help you build a healthy routine to take care of your mental health, achieve your goals, and live a beautiful life.","2020-04-21","2025-08-25","21","0","0","0","0","21","21","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","EXACT: Gratitude: Self-Care Journal (11e7466703904239956f9a1b454acffb)","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, Subscription, In-App Purchase","Offline, Own Your Own Data, Email or Export Your Data, Accessibility","Journaling, Picture Gallery/Hope Board, Track Mood","Diary, Camera, Surveys, External Devices, Social Network, Microphone","Summary of Data, Notifications, Social Network, Reminders, References/Information","Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Device, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is De-Identified Data Shared, App Reports Security Measures in Place","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges), Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gratitude-happiness-journal/id1372575227","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.northstar.gratitude","https://gratefulness.me/","vball354@yahoo.com","sdl182201@gmail.com","1587483889763","1756092867614"

It's based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, tested, and shown to work.\n\n\I have already had my eyes opened to so many new tools in only one forty minute session with the app.\\n\n\Thank you so much. I'm seriously about to cry because today's session was so important and useful to me.\ \n\n*SCIENCE*\n\nA pilot study of 80 UpLift users showed that in just 1 month, those who stuck with the program had nearly a 50% reduction in depression scores that lasted, as well as a 37% reduction in anxiety scores. (1)\n\nUpLift was developed by expert psychologists and leaders from the field of mobile mental health. It's based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, which has been used to treat people with anxiety and depression for over 30 years. \n\n*SESSIONS*\n\nUpLift provides you with 11 interactive psychology sessions that are around 45 minutes long each week. In the sessions, you'll be answering questions, doing self care exercises, and getting customized feedback and guidance to strengthen your well-being.\n\nHere are some of the sessions you'll work through:\n\n- The Emotional Equation\n- Positive Activities\n- Lies Depression Tells You\n- Recognizing Thought Errors\n- Confronting Thought Errors\n\nAfter the sessions, you'll unlock tools in your toolbox. \n\n*MOOD TRACKER*\n\nUpLift includes a free Mood Journal, otherwise known as a mood diary. Use it to track your emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, and watch your progress on your mood chart.\n\n*TOOLBOX*\n\nThe toolbox contains tools that enable you to apply the skills you learn in the sessions to your daily life. \n\nHere's a sample of some of the tools you'll unlock with UpLift: \n\n- Problem Solver\n- Daily Mood Tracking\n- Trigger Plan\n- Thought Errors\n- Anger Management\n- Goal Trainer\n- Mood Boosters\n\n*COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY*\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy is a type of psychotherapy based on the idea that modifying thought and behavior patterns was more important than understanding the psychological origins of behavior. \n\nBecause this type of counseling does not require the presence of a therapist, attempts were soon made to automate the process, first with “bibliotherapy” (CBT self-help books), and then with “CCBT,” or Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.\n\nUpLift is a new generation of CCBT (now called “iCBT”). UpLift uses our own proprietary programming technology to make it dynamic and responsive and modern UX design to make it a pleasure to use, while maintaining tried-and-proven CBT methods at it's heart.\n\n*PRICING*\n\nUpLift is free to download and the first session is free of charge. You can unlock all of the sessions and the entire toolkit via an auto-renewing subscription with a 7 day free trial. \n\nPayment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription of 1 year will automatically be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same subscription length and price unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

You can be sad, happy, excited, or depressed, it doesn't matter. The thing that matters is how you interact with these emotions because even when you are happy you need to be able to let go of this happiness and not try to prolong it artificially because there will be consequences. Meditation is a perfect solution to this. It will help you to relax and calm down. Freeing yourself from emotions and thoughts is an important skill that we need to master. Also, a good tool for this is simple sleep because sleep is like a small natural meditation that will lift some stress and let you rest. After sleep you are renewed, everything seems less scary and more possible. There is one more common thing in these two states. The thing is that they are not so easy to attain. Meditation asks from you concentration, proper breathing techniques, and a clear mind at the same time. Sleep is supposed to have good quality and be healthy. Sounds hard, isn’t it? But we can and we want to help you with that. Our app was created specifically for these purposes, to help people how to meditate and improve their sleep.\nHow do we help you achieve improvements in your sleep and how will our app teach you meditation?\nAkamu free app has a library of different sounds, music, articles, the practice of mindfulness, and lectures. Let’s look closer at them. They can be used separately for something specific. For example, music and sounds are there to help you fall asleep, concentrate, practice your meditation skills and relax. But we would recommend you combine them. After a lecture about how to start to meditate, you can immediately jump to proper composition, the sound of nature, or mantra and begin practice. That way you will gain as much profit as possible. While you are heading somewhere by taxi or by bus you can turn on music for concentration and read articles that we gathered. This will allow us to absorb and understand information better. Akamu is a versatile free app that helps you not only with things we mentioned before, but while you practice them passively you will become more relaxed, and more open-minded, but you will also begin to understand yourself better, and it will be easier for you to go through stressful situations, anxiety will slowly disappear from your life. Our goal is not just to teach you how to meditate or improve your sleep, we want to give you the possibility to have a spiritual journey whenever you need/want to.\nSo, let’s sum up what our app has:\nCourses and lectures that will teach you meditation and not only\nPractices of mindfulness so you would understand yourself better\nSounds of nature and music for different purposes like concentrating or meditating\nSleep practices to improve its quality\nSpiritual improvement, calmness, and relaxation are things that will come after you use our app for some period of time\nAkamu is a place where you can improve spiritually. Essential knowledge of how to become better in form that is easy to understand even for somebody who is new at this. Akamu free app is your pocket guide in your spiritual journey.","2023-05-31","2025-05-19","5","0","0","0","0","5","5","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Own Your Own Data","Psychoeducation, Deep Breathing, Picture Gallery/Hope Board, Track Medication","","Reminders, Summary of Data, Notifications, References/Information","Non-Specific, Sleep, Stress & Anxiety","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Device, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help, Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/akamu-meditation-calming/id1533037425","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.akamu.ru","https://akamu.io/","daniela_basadre@brown.edu","selzzt@bu.edu","1685574957738","1747617012106"

A few slide and tap action is enough for logging data.\n\nBlood Pressure Categories:\n\nWhat is blood pressure?\nAccording the National Institute Of Aging, Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of arteries as the heart pumps blood. When a health care professional measures your blood pressure, they use a blood pressure cuff around your arm that gradually tightens. The results are given in two numbers. The first number, called systolic blood pressure, is the pressure caused by your heart contracting and pushing out blood. The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, is the pressure when your heart relaxes and fills with blood.\n\nThe blood pressure categories definition is from \n2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: The Task Force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)  from \nhttps://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/33/3021/5079119\n\nand 2017 Guideline for High Blood Pressure in Adults by American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association\nfrom \nhttps://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/ten-points-to-remember/2017/11/09/11/41/2017-guideline-for-high-blood-pressure-in-adults","2023-01-13","2025-05-13","9","0","0","0","7","2","9","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","SIMILAR: Blood Pressure App Pro (234b08e154af42a19f4c84203da26a2e); PARTIAL: Blood Pressure (277c4c569dda458d96c7f04d7713f28a)","iOS","Free to Download, Payment, In-App Purchase","Email or Export Your Data, Own Your Own Data, Offline","Psychoeducation, Journaling, Track Mood, Track Symptoms","Surveys, Diary","Notifications, References/Information, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data, Reminders","Cardiovascular Health","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Can Opt Out of Data Collection","Self Help, Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning","For Profit Company","User Generated Data","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blood-pressure-app-log/id1607736543?platform=iphone","","","msingh10@bidmc.harvard.edu","aegbe@bu.edu","1673625835750","1747174283884"

What if you could immediately reset your mood, with a quick relief step?\n\nSometimes it's hard to tell your family and friends how you feel. We make it easy.  You choose when to share and when not to share.\n\nSometimes it's hard to be consistent with self-care. We make it fun.\n\nOne reason therapy is helpful at times is because it gives us a chance to share how we feel.  Sometimes it's easier to share our feelings with a stranger than our own loved ones.   Although it can be difficult to share how we really feel with our family and friends, the reward is intimacy, support, deep relationships and fulfillment.   Calling, texting, or telling them in person can sometimes feel too scary.  \n\nWith NeuraBoot, you can easily let your friends or family know, in a way that feels more safe.   By taking this important sharing step, you are doing something even braver.  You are letting them know they can also let you know how they feel. \n\nIf we all felt safe enough to share how we really felt, how much more could we help each other?   If instead of always saying \I'm fine\ in response to \How are you?\, what if we could say the truth?   \I'm sad because I am going through a break-up and sometimes it still hurts.\   How often do we do that?  And what would it feel like if we did?\n\nWe are your partner in feeling better. We get you, and we'll help your family and friends get you, too, by building deeper relationships than you've ever had.\n\nHaving strong connections and a support system is a proven way to improve your emotional health and well-being. We know that when you need help, you need it now, not two weeks from now in therapy. \nWith NeuraBoot, you can log your moods, easily connect with your support system and swipe through custom action steps to pick just the one you want to feel better in the moment.  You can also log your moods, feelings, and progress to review with a counselor or therapist during sessions.\n\nNeuraBoot Features:\n\nMood tracker\nRelationship building and intimacy development\nSelf-awareness development\nAction steps for quick relief from anxiousness, sadness or anger\nAction steps to promote emotional growth\nProgress chart\n\n\nNeuraBoot is emotional coaching designed to help users develop awareness and emotional strength.

Built on a skills-based approach that helps children in early and middle childhood build a healthier relationship with life, stress, and anxiety, Mindful Powers™ empowers kids to bring calm to their lives at the touch of their fingertips.\n\nDownload Mindful Powers™ today to experience the first three Mindful Play lessons for free! \nIdeal for kids aged 7 – 10\n\nMindful Powers™ is designed to be a part of your child’s daily routine. It is simple, easy, and fun to use, so kids can pick it up and use it at any point in their day. The two key features are:\n• Mindful Play | voice-guided mindfulness sessions\n• Focus Time | a task timer\n\nMindful play:\nThrough a series of 10 progressive and interactive voice-guided sessions, kids learn how to master the powers of mindfulness – the ability to know and understand what is happening in one’s head at any given moment, without getting carried away by it. Before each lesson, kids sooth their very own Flibbertigibbet™, who is in an agitated state, with the touch of their finger. This sensory-based repetitive interaction triggers the body’s rest and digest response, helping kids relax and regain focus.\n \nFocus time:\nThe Flibbertigibbet™ self-set timer helps kids set mental parameters around a given task by applying focus time until completion. When the focus timer is on, Mindful Powers™ deters kids from using the device for any other purpose, encouraging them to work towards completing their tasks.\n\nMindful Powers helps grow the following skills:\n• Calmness & relaxation\n• Stress & anxiety reduction  \n• Concentration & focus\n• Navigating big emotions\n• Getting along with others\n\n“Mindful Powers™ is not a cookie cutter approach to mindfulness. Based on contextual behavioral science and inspired by an approach to therapy called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, it recognizes that the mindfulness experience is a psychological experience that can be learned in small bits and gradually presented and trained.”\n— Dr. Roger Vilardaga, Assistant Professor at Duke University\n\nMindful Powers Awards:\n• GOLD Winner: The Davey Awards, Best Mobile Apps/Site - Health & Wellness\n• GOLD Winner: The W3 Awards, Best Mobile Apps/Site - Family & Kids\n• Best Learning App: Kidscreen Awards 2019 — Original\n• Finalist: 2018 Cynopsis Imagination Awards - Mobile App – K6-11\n\nThe content and lessons included in Mindful Powers™ were developed in consultation with Dr. Roger Vilardaga, a Clinical Psychologist and Assistant Professor at Duke University’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences\n\n*Mindful Powers™ is not intended to clinically treat kids with behavioral and/or emotional challenges.\n\nPlease note, In-App Purchases are not included in Family Sharing.

Our built in time counter will let you know how much time you save per day since quitting. \n \nHere are our top 10 reasons to quit smoking tobacco:\n \n1. You will breath easier\n \nCarbon Monoxide in the cigarettes blocks the uptake of oxygen in your blood. This improves within hours of quitting.\n \n2. Take a free vacation every year with the money you have saved\n \nCigarettes can be expensive. For example, it costs over $3,000 per year for a one-pack-per-day smoker. You will also save money on cleaning expenses, insurance premiums, etc.\n \n3. You will look younger\n \nSmoking is associated with multiple skin problems, especially premature facial wrinkles and constriction of blood vessels.\n \n4. Meet that special someone\n \nSurveys show that most single people will not even consider dating a smoker. “Kissing a smoker is like licking and ashtray,” as the popular saying goes.\n \n5. Get close to people with confidence\n \nThe sense of smell is impaired for smokers, but nonsmokers can smell the cigarette use immediately.\n \n6. Taste buds will improve\n \nAs your sense of smell improves, so will your sense of taste.\n \n7. Avoid having children who smoke\n \nA very strong factor associated with starting smoking is having a parent who smokes. After all, kids do as you do, not as you say.\n \n8. Minimize your stress and enjoy all the extra time\n \nDon’t stress about where, when, and how you are going to take those smoking breaks, or how you are going to survive long travel times. Use your newfound free time to focus on family, career, and life goals that matter to you.\n \n9. Be proud of your smile\n \nThe yellow film on the teeth of smokers improves every time an ex-smoker brushes his or her teeth.\n \n10. Live healthier and longer\n \nThe body can be more forgiving than you think. The risks of heart disease, stroke, cancer and many other medical problems eventually return to that of a NEVER smoker. Studies show that at ANY age, you will live longer if you stop smoking.\n \nHaving an issue with smoking is not uncommon in modern society. Unfortunately tobacco/nicotine is a very addictive substance and can cause long term damage.

Watching our high school peers greatly harming their fundamental organs gave us a unique perspective on the widespread usage of harmful substances. Additionally, we also understood how pressing other lung issues were to society through research into lung-related diseases. Specifically, COPD was an affliction that we saw as extremely pressing. With that in mind, we thought that a free, quick COPD screening test could positively benefit users as well. After weeks of development, PulmonaryScan was born. With a simplistic design and easy to use interface, PulmonaryScan is divided into 5 sections, which are detailed below:\n\n\nSober Counter: The Sober Counter is a multi-faceted approach to helping those on a path to staying smoking free on their journey. First, the user is prompted to enter in the average amount of usage per week of Cigarettes, Juul Pods, or both. After that, the user will be taken to the main screen, where an auto-updating counter will tell the user how many days they have been able to stay abstinent from their smoking habit (if a user unfortunately consumes smoking products, they can easily hit the \relapse\ button to start over). Additionally, the Sober Counter will also tell the user how much money they have saved in total over the course of their sober journey, as well as their expected savings of money over the course of the following month and year. This feature will allow the user to directly see the benefits of their tough fight against addiction, hopefully encouraging them to keep up their great work.\n\nThe COPD Screening test is an interactive questionnaire engineered by PulmonaryScan to help individuals discern if they need further evaluation by a medical professional regarding their COPD/Bronchitis/Emphysema symptoms. This examination is comprised of 8 short questions regarding one's symptoms and conditions, and one interactive question to examine the performance of the user's lungs. Results of the test will then be analyzed, and a recommendation regarding further examination will be made.\n\n\nBody Map: The Body Map is an interactive interface in which users can tap into the different body systems to see how smoking specifically affects each part of one's body.

This is an app designed by scientists based on existing evidence and clinical guidelines regarding smoking cessation [https://www.cancer.gov/publications/patient-education/clearing-the-air].  The effectiveness of this app will be tested, as funded by a grant from the American Cancer Society [https://www.cancer.org/].  The key innovation of this app is its use of positive psychology, which is a promising new approach to smoking cessation [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4612345/].  The happiness exercises used in this app have been fully vetted [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547218303349], and the app provides scientific facts and insights along the way (i.e., “Owl Wisdoms”).  Our goal is to inform and empower, while engaging you in daily practices that enhance and/or maintain your happiness, while you undertake the challenge of quitting smoking.\n\nHow Well Does It Work?\n\nThe app you are downloading is Version 2 of this app.  It builds on the feedback received by participants in a study evaluating Version 1 of the app [https://www.iproc.org/2018/2/e11762/], who found the app easy to use and useful, and whose confidence to quit smoking increased, and urge to smoke decreased.  Thirty percent of study participants were biochemically confirmed to be abstinent from smoking 2 weeks after their chosen quit day, and 6 months after the chosen quit day, 55% of study participants reported having been abstinent from smoking for the past 30 days.\n\n\nBy Using This App You Support Science\n\nOver the next year, we will gather data and feedback on this version of the app.  Based on this information, we will further improve and streamline this app, and then test its effectiveness in a randomized clinical trial.  By using this app, you are providing valuable data to us.  As you use the app, and if you permit it, we will log how you use the app (e.g., percent of days on which you completed a happiness exercise, number of behavioral challenges you completed) to give us an idea of how well this app works.  We are also conducting a 2nd study on how using this app impacts smoking cessation (if you want to join the study, find more information here [https://scholar.harvard.edu/bettina.hoeppner/sis]).  Beyond these two ways of providing us with valuable data and feedback, you could also simply email us and share your thoughts and feedback – we would love to hear from you!  To provide feedback, simply email the study team (sis@mgh.harvard.edu) or the principal investigator for this app directly, Dr. Bettina Hoeppner (bhoeppner@mgh.harvard.edu).\n\nGood luck with your quit attempt!  Quitting smoking is critically important to your health – including quitting occasional smoking.  We hope this app will make you smile along the way, and support you in reaching your goal.\n\nKey words\n    • Happiness\n    • Smoking \n    • Cigarette\n    • Quitting \n    • Science\n    • Positive psychology\n    • American Cancer Society\n    • Harvard Medical School","2021-07-22","2024-10-21","10","0","0","0","0","10","10","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android, iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Journaling, Goal Setting/Habits, Track Mood, Track Symptoms","Diary","References/Information, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data, Notifications, Reminders","Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Reports Security Measures in Place, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Supporting Studies","Academic Institution","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges)","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smiling-instead-of-smoking/id1469385605","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.previewlabs.sis&hl=en_US&gl=US","","klara.aastroem@yale.edu","sdl182201@gmail.com","1626976648272","1729474003807"

The application is the embodiment of a method and a tool to help your self-control, and the method will work only if you have a conscious desire to get rid of a bad habit or control cigarette or vape consumption.\n\nIt will also help to quit smoking vape, IQOS, Glo, Juul and any other tobacco heating systems.\n\nDownload the app and read the FAQ section to find out how it works and why it works.\n\nEnter your settings:\n- The count of cigarettes you smoke per day now. (or the count of puff of the vape).\n- The count of cigarettes (or count of vape puff) you are aiming for (zero if you want to quit smoking).\n- The number of days in which you want to get this result.\n- The cost of a pack of cigarettes or 20 puffs of vape.\nStart the timer.\n\nWill help those who:\n\n- Wants to become a non-smoker\nThe effective recommended time range is 100-200 days. You can quit faster, but it will be difficult and the risk is higher that you will fall out again and start smoking.\n\n- Wants to smoke less\nNot everyone is ready to completely quit smoking, but every smoker wants to do as little harm as possible to their health and save money. Therefore, the application has functionality that allows you to reduce the number of cigarettes to the level you need and save it. (Of course, we recommend getting rid of the habit completely)\nIf you smoke more than one pack a day and it seems to you that you cannot quit, but you feel what harm you are causing to your health and understand how much money you could save, then try first to reduce the number of cigarettes by 2 times in 60-100 days.\nIf you smoke one pack a day, then reducing the number of cigarettes by 2 times will allow you to save 25,000 rubles a year or more, given that cigarette prices continue to rise.\n\n- Doesn't want to quit smoking\nYou understand what is needed, but you like the process and you do not really want to give up the habit. Are you afraid of getting fat, you're stressed at work, or you've come up with other \weighty\ arguments.\nIn this case, enter 365+ days in the settings (you can 500, 800, 1000). You will be throwing so slowly that you yourself will not notice it. And you can finally take control of your cigarette consumption with the help of a tracker.\n\nThe app will discipline you and you will get rid of the triggers that made you reach for a pack of cigarettes or vape.\nWhen leaving the house, after eating, at the bus stop, while driving, the timer will always tell you how much time is left until the next cigarette or puff of vape.\nThis will unlearn the habit of smoking in a particular situation. These situations will cease to be a trigger like an ordinary non-smoker.\n\n\nYou don't have to dream about a cigarette during the withdrawal process, because there will be none and you will smoke when the timer tells you when.\n\nMechanically follow the timetable provided by the timer to tell a passerby who fired a cigarette one day - I don't smoke.\n\n A savings calculator is built into the settings, see how much money you will save, depending on how many days you decide to quit smoking.\nLet me remind you that it is very important to develop a habit and constantly use the timer in order to quit smoking slowly and gradually.\n\nGet used to using the timer for several months and then you will get the result you are striving for. Free money, health, lack of shortness of breath, normal smell and increased lifespan. (To run fast, smell good and spend money)\n\nWith this free app, you don't need so much motivation to become a non-smoker. And if you need it, that is, the Premium version, with it you will more faithfully find inner motivation, because no one likes to waste money.\n\n\nMail for communication: swaysupp@gmail.com","2021-07-14","2024-10-21","8","0","0","0","0","8","8","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Subscription, In-App Purchase, Payment","Offline, Spanish","Goal Setting/Habits, Track Symptoms","","Summary of Data, Notifications, Reminders","Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Data Stored on Server, Is PHI Shared, Has Privacy Policy, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared","Self Help","Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Well Written Relevant Content, Can Cause Harm","For Profit Company","User Generated Data","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stopsmoke.metodshamana&hl=en_US&gl=US","","klara.aastroem@yale.edu","yoelkys.morales@tufts.edu","1626294098489","1729552772288"

You can keep a track of how many real cigarettes you replaced with a simulated one, and won't have to give up those smoke breaks.\nWant to quit smoking and you tried all the existing methods you have heard of? Quitting cold turkey didn't help me either, because after 2 or 3 days, I was back to buying a new pack of cigarettes and smoking half of it in one day, because I felt that I deserved to. \n\n But with this app, you can trick your brain into thinking that you are smoking, because:\n- App will tell you to synchronize your breathing with the virtual cigarette, so you get the feeling that you're still inhaling the smoke\n- Don't lose the flicking of the cigarette habit, because the app gives you the option to flick the ash off of it (also tricks are available)\n- The time spent for smoking the virtual cigarette is similar to the real one, so you still get those smoking breaks that you are used to\n- May not be for everyone, but if you still have a familiar feeling by seeing an ash tray, this is also included in the app :)\n- Get rewards when you replace enough cigarettes\n\nFor many people, the habit of smoking just boils down not to the tobacco or nicotine within the cigarettes, but the feeling that you are in charge of your time, or you take advantage of the time to reflect and to think about current issues or problems. Or either for socializing with other people :) No matter the purpose, every smoker who tries to quit will miss that feeling they had when they took a smoking break. \n\nIf you tried already giving up smoking, you know that you have to occupy your time with something to distract you, and to not think about lighting another cigarette. Well with this app, this would be easier, because it will occupy your time with something that you're already familiar with, the habbit of smoking without the cigarettes.\n\nTry it every time you go for a smoking break, and instead of lighting a real cigarette, start smoking one in the app, and there will be at least one cigarette less in your lungs, and one more in the app.\n\nGood luck quitting smoking! And remember, giving up bad habits is not actually quitting, because quitting is just a easy way out. What you are doing is remarkable!","2021-08-20","2024-10-04","9","0","0","0","0","9","9","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","SIMILAR: Adiquit: Quit smoking (c045bfda17a540ce89213aedbb1ad471)","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline, Accessibility, Own Your Own Data","Track Symptoms, Goal Setting/Habits","Surveys","Notifications, Reminders, Summary of Data","Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","Has Privacy Policy, Can Delete Data, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Videos, Gamification (Points/Badges), Audio/Music/Scripts, User Generated Data","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mates.petru.smoquit&hl=en_US&gl=US","","klara.aastroem@yale.edu","bdwyer@bidmc.harvard.edu","1629503213246","1728073810927"

There are thousands of \quit smoking\ apps out there, but none have the love and time invested as this app.\n\n• No-nonsense: It doesn't want to annoy you with notifications every 5 minutes likes other apps do. It doesn't want you to log in to your social media. It doesn't want to know your location. It only wants you to quit!\n\n• Time-tracking: The app tracks your time free of smoke by the second, giving you detailed info of the chemicals you've avoided by quitting, as well as the money saved. Save money AND your health. Heck yes.\n\n• Lets you smoke (sometimes): The app allows you to smoke if you REALLY need to. You can smoke up to 5.5 cigarettes per day. The app will use video ads to deter you from doing so.\n\n• Health-tracking: It shows your health benefits according to when you last smoked. Ever wondered how much Acetaldehyde you've avoided since you last smoked? Check! Isoprene? Check! Tar? Check! In addition, the apps shows you the peer-reviewed papers it bases its calculations on (e.g. Cancer risk, insulin resistance, inflammation markers, etc).\n\n• Money-tracking: Tracks the millions* you'll save by quitting. You can show your wife/husband that you've saved enough for that huge TV you've been thinking of getting without* getting yelled at. All thanks to SmokeQuitter.\n\n• Lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral cavity cancer, insulin resistance, carbon monoxide poisoning, inflammation markers... it tracks it all.\n\n• Tips: SmokeQuitter gives you craving \tips\ as well as allowing you to smoke if things get too ugly (it tracks this too!). It promotes the usage of validated smoking-cessation techniques/products to help improve your chances of quitting (This App does NOT replace a medically assisted cessation therapy monitored by a specialist).\n\n• Friends: SmokeQuitter allows you to keep track of friends that are also trying to quit. Just scan their QR code from their SmokeQuitter App and BAM. No social media involved. No \please log-in to continue\. \n\n*: Results may vary.","2021-08-11","2024-10-04","8","0","0","0","0","8","8","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, In-App Purchase","Offline, Spanish, Accessibility","Goal Setting/Habits, Track Symptoms, Productivity","Surveys, Camera, Geolocation","Notifications, References/Information, Reminders, Graphs of Data","Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning, Can Cause Harm","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges), Network Support","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fgglabs.smokequitter&hl=en_US&gl=US","","klara.aastroem@yale.edu","bdwyer@bidmc.harvard.edu","1628710597200","1728071117897"

VERY VERY good app.\ - celebration72\n\nDialectical Behavior Therapy Skills are a must, not just for people who have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), but for just about anyone living in this world alongside others.\n\nAre they necessary skills? No. Could anyone benefit from them? Yes.\n\nDBT Skills Groups are booked out weeks and often times months in advance. This means that if you want to get in one, you may be waiting for a long long time, especially if NOW is when you need help.\n\nDBT Skills Groups focus on SKILLS. This means that practicing the skills is much more important than anything else. And luckily, once you learn the skills, you will retain them for the rest of your life!\n\nIf you are practicing DBT Skills and want a Diary Card, this app is great for you since it has the following:\n• A Calendar to add a Daily Diary Card with 28 DBT skills.\n• Descriptions of each skill if you forget\n• Examples of each skill\n• Statistical information based on 1 day, 7 days, 28 days, or ALL records. That way if you are in a weekly DBT class, you can easily see which skills you have been focusing on, and which you have been missing.\n• A Notification reminder that you can set to remind you daily at a specific time to do your DBT Skills Diary Card.\n• Beautiful photos and artwork along with a backdrop that changes based on what season we are in (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring).\n• Add your own music to the DBT Skills Diary Card to make the experience more enjoyable.\n• Full Version Users: You can now send PDF files with your diary card stats + notes via email, or print to your AirPrint printer straight from within the app. Email your therapist/counselor with just a few taps in an easy to read and print format!\n• As part of our series of DBT apps, your progress will be saved between apps as well, so you'll have access to all your data no matter which DBT app you are in.\n• Unlock more than 1 type of Diary Card so you can continue doing your daily card in a format that fits your lifestyle!\n• Want to track extra information? Though DBT classes don't require it, you can add custom tracking data for each Daily Diary Card entry. Of course, since this is optional, you simply need to toggle it on to start tracking right away.\n    a) Track Anxiety and Depression using a modified K10 test.\n    b) Track Target Behaviors and your response to them.\n\nThis is the most enjoyable DBT Skills Diary Card in the App Store!

We focus on teaching about CBT because outside research shows, again and again, that it the most effective form of therapy to improve mental well-being for the vast majority of folks who experience symptoms of mild to moderate anxiety or depression. Studies show that patients can get the benefits of learning CBT techniques without an in-person therapist. Bloom gives users the power to learn about mental health in a guided & self-directed way at their own pace.\n\nWHAT USERS SAY\nBloom is considered a cheaper and more accessible option:\n“Not everybody has access or can afford a therapist. This is like a therapist in my pocket. Personalized but still private.”\n“I love that I can do it at my own time and I don’t have to feel awkward talking to a stranger about my life.”\n“It’s an easy and private discrete thing, no one even has to know!”\n\nWHEN SHOULD I USE CBT?\nCBT can help people with depression by giving you tools to challenge the negative thoughts and override them with more realistic and positive thought processes. CBT is also used to help many more psychological problems. In some cases, other forms of therapy used at the same time may be recommended for best results. Self-Therapy is best for people with mild to moderate mental health problems. If you experience severe anxiety or depression, Bloom can be a great add-on to therapy, however we do recommend speaking with a professional in severe situations.\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nWe’re always keen on getting feedback from you.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us.\nRead more about our terms and conditions here:\nTerms of service: https://www.enjoybloom.com/terms\nPrivacy policy: https://www.enjoybloom.com/privacy\nEmail us: support@enjoybloom.com","2020-04-28","2024-08-11","13","0","0","0","0","13","13","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","iOS","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Accessibility, Own Your Own Data","Track Mood, Journaling, Deep Breathing, Goal Setting/Habits, Psychoeducation, Track Sleep, Track Symptoms","Surveys, Diary","Notifications, Social Network, Reminders, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data, References/Information","Non-Specific","Data Stored on Server, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is PHI Shared","Self Help, Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency, Use Warning","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Videos, Audio/Music/Scripts, Gamification (Points/Badges), AI Support","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bloom-cbt-therapy-self-care/id1475128511","","","slagan@bidmc.harvard.edu","aegbe@bu.edu","1588035155235","1723341385874"

A key technique in behavior therapy for anxiety, exposure therapy involves gradually exposing someone to their feared object, situation, or task without any danger in order to overcome their anxiety. This app enables people to go through exposure therapy.\n\nBefore exposure, users first create a fear hierarchy - a list of activities that induce anxiety ranked from highest to lowest. Then, they work through the activities in the fear hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-inducing activity and working their way up.\n\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. \n\nDetailed Guide:\nMany people with phobias recognize their fear as illogical, but their mind is still afraid nonetheless. This is because the primal fear centers of our mind act subconsciously whenever it spots anything it thinks is dangerous (such as lions or snakes) in order to escape immediately. However, in today's modern society when we don't have to worry about predators eating us, our minds can often trigger false alarms to things that aren't actually dangerous. \n\nThe fear center of our mind learns through association, not logic. If you were afraid of pigeons, every time you see a pigeon your fear would rise. Then when you run away, your mind becomes even more convinced that a pigeon is dangerous because you ran away, your fear levels dropped, and you were safe. This cycle repeats itself, sustaining the illogical fear until maybe you avoid going to certain places because there might be pigeons there. \n\nTo break this fear, the mind needs to learn to un-associate pigeons with fear. Luckily, the mind can only sustain a fear response for so long. So if you go to where pigeons are and just stay there instead of running away, eventually your mind will learn that pigeons are not actually dangerous. The most important principle is to make sure that the fear leaves before you do. \n\nThis app helps you break the fear. First, add what you are afraid of and then construct a list of activities that will induce various levels of anxiety. Then, you can start exposing yourself by doing these activities starting from what gives you the least amount of anxiety. During the exposure process, you can track your anxiety levels by updating it continuously, and finish when it falls to 20/100 or lower. As you work your away through the activities, your fear should continue to fall! \n\nWarning: We highly recommend using this app under the guidance of a mental health professional. If you leave the activity before your anxiety falls, then this will actually reinforce your fear instead of lowering it. Try starting with the easiest activity first. Going straight to a challenging task might actually increase your fear. It is very difficult to stay in a situation when your entire body is screaming at you to leave, especially if there is no person there coaxing you to stay and wait.","2023-06-15","2024-07-29","3","0","0","0","0","3","3","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Track Symptoms","","","Phobias","","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning","For Profit Company","User Generated Data","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/exposure-face-your-fears/id1135230491","","","agusia@bu.edu","sdl182201@gmail.com","1686797280513","1722211383173"

You are never asked for your real name and we’ll never disclose your personal information.\n• A variety of topics to choose from, including Marriage problems, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and many more.\n\n\nWHY USE THERAPEER?\nYou're not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment.\nYes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it.\nYes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don’t always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too.\nYes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there's no anonymity. There are certain issues you don’t want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that.\nBut most of all: Other support group formats aren't focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there's no guarantee that anyone will even respond. Sometimes, you just want the focus to be on YOU.\n\nWe get all of that. We get YOU.\n\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n• Provide other community members with emotional support as a Peer. By doing so, it will help you deal with your own challenges in a broader perspective and will make you feel better by knowing you helped others in need.\n• Already gained the gratification of helping others? Go ahead and create your very own support room (or, if you don't want to wait, we offer the option to purchase a credit to open your room immediately).\n• After your private anonymous Support Room is opened, we match you with other Therapeer community members who have struggled with something similar to what you're experiencing. Peer assignment is based on your personal preferences and on the topic being discussed.\n\nJoin Therapeer today! Transform your struggles into strength, support people in need, and improve your own emotional well-being.\n\nCONNECT WITH US!\nFeel free to contact us anytime with your questions, comments, and suggestions.

They also help those with mental illness to keep track of their symptoms. When you keep a daily record of your moods, you learn a lot about yourself and your mental state, allowing you to take better care of yourself. \n\nOne benefit of mood tracking is that you will be able to learn what your triggers are. People with anxiety can also benefit from understanding their triggers to avoid situations that cause a serious panic attack or anxiety attack. Those with PTSD can immensely benefit from knowing their triggers to avoid situations that may cause a serious episode. Or if you are working on depression with Cognitive-behavioral therapy, you can start developing healthy coping mechanisms by identifying your emotional patterns.\n\n**** ****\nTracking moods, emotions & thoughts with Mindflo\nExtensive mood library\nMindflo has a vast set of moods for you to capture how you exactly feel every day easily. You can even force-tap to reveal more emotion options to go deeper into your emotion.\n\nBeautiful simple journal\nMindflo is designed as a simple and beautiful mood tracker from scratch. It has a minimalistic journal layout inspired by calendars. Beautiful pastel colors help you express and categorize your emotion.\n\nCapture mood triggers\nAdd a photo from your gallery or capture from your camera to log what exactly triggered the emotion. Adding pictures helps reflect on your past moods and identify your trigger patterns.\n\nDaily Check-ins\nYou can set up daily check-ins to ensure you never miss a day of logging your mood. Add up to 3 reminders every day to commit to a daily practice.\n\nRechecking in with your mood\nYou can schedule another reminder to recheck-in with your current mood in 2, 4, or 8 hours. This feature helps you capture a prolonged emotion across a day.\n\nUnlimited, free journal forever\n\n**** ****\nMindflo is the perfect mood tracker for therapy and self-care\nYour mental health provider or psychiatrist can use your mood logs and journal to give you a more accurate diagnosis, allowing them to provide you with the best treatment. Mindflo allows you and your psychiatrist to track your therapy or medication and learn how to help you cope with your feelings. Once they know what is triggers your negative emotions, they will be able to help you recognize your mood trends and combat them.\n\nMinflo’s easily transforms into your CBT Thought diary\nTransform your worries into balanced and helpful thoughts by identifying and challenging thinking that keeps you trapped in anxiety.\n\nIf you are struggling to understand your mental illness and manage your symptoms with a mental health provider, Mindflo could be a crucial tool for your journey.\n\n**** ****\nMindflo’s Privacy promise\nMindflo is the safest space on the internet for you to express freely. These four tenets help us ensure your data’s privacy & safety.\n\nYou own your data.\nWe securely sync all your Mindflo data only on your private iCloud storage. We keep no backups or copies on our servers. All data that you add, edit, and delete from one device will be synced permanently to iCloud. Only you have control of your data through your Apple iCloud account.\n\nNo accounts, emails, or PII\nWe save no Personally Identifiable Information(PII), nor do we identify you with an account/email. We believe that this data is a huge responsibility that apps take lightly. Mindflo is only linked to your iCloud account. Frankly, we don’t need anything else to keep your data safe.\n\nFull transparency\nWe are committed to logging only what we absolutely need to improve this app. To that end, we use Firebase to log crash reports, anonymous feature usage reports, and button taps.

It occurs spontaneously when we breathe at a rate of five to seven breaths per minute (instead of our usual 15-18). It results in a calm, restful alertness and many other benefits. \n\nQuick start video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXpsoGHnEiU&list=UUNMy2KojFn0jMbxbHZVppGw&index=4\n\nAbout Resonance\n\nThe effects of resonance supports the innate ability of our body, nervous system, and emotions to restore themselves through the balancing of the complementary branches of our autonomic nervous system, which control our heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, respiration, and many other automatic functions of the body. \n\nThere have been hundreds of scientific studies performed on resonant breathing, which show a wide array of benefits, including reduction of inflammation, reduction of stress, improved sleep, improved resiliency, and strengthening of cardiovascular function. \n\nHow is it possible for one breathing technique to do so much? The answer lies within our nervous system. By breathing at resonance, we enter into an even balance between the two branches of our autonomic nervous system, the sympathetic (which moves us towards activity) and the parasympathetic, which moves us towards rest. \n\nThe sympathetic branch is our accelerator, and speeds us up. The parasympathetic is our braking system, which slows us down. We alternate between these two every second of the day, with each breath we take. \n\nHowever, in our fact paced, information heavy world, we often lean towards acceleration. Spending just a few minutes consciously breathing sends signals of balance to our brain, telling us that we are ok, and brings us out from the part of our brain that makes us feel overwhelmed, into a state of calm. With resonant breathing, you learn how to apply your brake at will, rather than being sidelined by anxiety, distractedness, or excess stress. \n\nOur world is very much in sympathetic overdrive: we are overly active, overly plugged in, and live in a world of both heated politics and climate. It’s important to learn to cool down, so that we can be as effective in our lives as possible, and conscious breathing is one of the best ways to do that. The Breathing App, by virtue of toning the vagus nerve, reduces inflammation, and induces a state of restful alertness and mental clarity.\n\nResonant breathing is like a stress reset button.\n\nAbout the creators of the Breathing App\n\nEddie Stern, a yoga teacher, author and lecturer from New York, created the concept, and drew the blueprint for the app.\n\nDeepak Chopra, MD, FACP, NYT best selling author of over 85 books, founder of the Chopra Center and Jiyo.com, guided the science and context behind the app.\n\nSergey Varichev, an app developer and coder from Belarus, currently living in Amsterdam, did the coding, and co-designed the app. \n\nMoby, a musician, DJ, author, and photographer born in New York City, who has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, developed the breathing cue sounds.","2020-07-16","2024-07-01","12","0","0","0","0","12","12","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Deep Breathing","","","Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Meets HIPAA, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Is PHI Shared","Self Help","Does What it Claims, Well Written Relevant Content, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-breathing-app/id1285982210","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ayny.breathingapp&hl=en_US","","jane.stanga@gmail.com","bdwyer@bidmc.harvard.edu","1594912706161","1719865238736"

Through the use of ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) and state-of-the-art privacy protocols, Vive Teens has been custom-built as a personal wellness companion for our teenagers. \n\nThe question we wanted to answer is:\nHow do we utilize the marvels of modern technology in an ethical, private, and responsible way to benefit our children and steer them onto a successful path?\n\nHOW DID WE DO IT?\nParents are enraged by excessive use of smartphones amongst teens who seem to be glued to apps of which some might not have wholesome and trustworthy content and are not necessarily endorsed by parents.\n\nWhat if we used the very technology that teenagers love, to educate, assist, and reward them through a personal wellness companion app that provides targeted content to help them address common psychological and social challenges that they face every day? Also, what if the app has real-time interactive capability that provides virtual companion chat as well as give teenagers access to counsellors and advice at the tip of their fingers?\n\nVive created such a wellness companion app that interacts with a teenager in an ultra-personalised fashion within a private “space”.\n\nSchools, parents, and teenagers have “app fatigue” as they are bombarded with numerous apps that communicate schedules, announcements, and other education-related information. Are these apps really assisting our teenagers and providing them with tools that equip them, or can it be that it simply creates more pressure?

Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone in this process to shake bulimia.\n \nBulimia is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with this condition binge eat. They then take steps to avoid weight gain. Most commonly, this means vomiting (purging). But it can also mean excessive exercising or fasting. Treatments include counseling, medications, and nutrition education.\n \nHere are our top 8 reasons to say no to bulimia:\n \n1. Stop feeling isolated from others\n \nIt is not easy to explain to others why you have to go to the bathroom and throw up after a meal. Bulimia keeps you in a bubble, and that cannot be a good thing. Social experience is a part of being human, and when you start isolating yourself for being Bulimic, you experience emotional and physical pain.\n \n2. Malnutrition is a big issue\n \nMalnutrition happens when your body is deprived of essential calories and nutrients that you need to survive. The constant food restriction of Bulimia makes your body malnourished and more prone to illnesses and disease.\n \n3. Bulimic dehydration\n \nMild dehydration will cause dry skin, head rushes, chills, and weakness. More serious dehydration will lead to increased heart rate and heavier breathing. If you let it go any farther than this, you will be at risk for cardiac arrest, seizures, and even unconsciousness.\n \n4. Bulimia makes you lose hair\n \nThe lack of nutrients entering your body forces your body to condense its functional responses. Anything that your body feels unnecessary for survival will start to get less nutrients. This starts with your hair. Your hair may thin or start falling out.\n \n5. Random thin hairs will start growing on your body\n \nYour body must compensate for the lack of insulation that your body provides, so in a last ditch attempt to save your internal temperature; you will start growing thin hairs on your face and in other unwanted areas of the body.\n \n6. Bulimia makes your fingernails brittle\n \nThis goes back to the lack of nutrition flowing through your body. Your fingernails are not an essential part of your body when you are not getting enough nutrients, so your body will shut down the flow of nutrients to your nails.\n \n7. You could become infertile!\n \nBody fat is essential for menstruation. Not only will you lose your ability to become pregnant, but you will also stop having your period. Some may see this as a perk, but extended periods of this will lead to permanent infertility.\n \n8. Bone loss\n \nWith Bulimia, bones become more brittle because of the lack of nutrient delivery. This will lead to having weaker bones and increase the chances of your bones breaking.\n\n \nIf you are having trouble with bulimia or being bulimic, simply download Bulimia Nervosa Help Calendar for FREE and get help now!","2021-06-14","2024-01-25","11","0","0","0","0","11","11","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android, iOS","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Offline, Email or Export Your Data, Accessibility","Picture Gallery/Hope Board, Goal Setting/Habits, Track Symptoms, Journaling","Diary, Camera, Surveys","Reminders, Notifications, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data, Social Network","Eating Disorders","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help","Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Well Written Relevant Content, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges)","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bulimia-nervosa-help-calendar/id1112384580","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BulimiaHelp.Calendar&hl=en_US&gl=US","http://appdiggity.com/","tolear01@tufts.edu","janeangellmikkelson@gmail.com","1623680996600","1706213630050"

While many have tried to imitate our work, none have achieved the sonic supremacy of the Naturespace thunderstorm series Thundergod. The experience under headphones is unmatched. Our unique 3D recording techniques not only recreate the sound of real storms, but also the detailed spatial characteristics of their unique environments. Follow the trajectories of hundreds of individual rumbles and strikes above you. Feel the rain on the leaves and in the water as wind pushes through the trees. Get lost aboard a giant wooden vessel as she navigates the squall. Thundergod faithfully recreates the variety of storms that have been witnessed through all of history, striking fear and awe into the heart of mankind across the ages.\n\nCompletely remastered, these storms are now much longer and stronger and are accompanied by a beautiful new UI with synchronized, full screen lightning flashes. Thundergod puts the combined power of 6 years of storm recordings in your pocket.\n\nUnlike music, which can be distracting, listening to our storms while working or relaxing gives your mind the space to think and focus by immersing you into amazingly real 3D spaces with intricate and detailed storms that are so long that they never feel repetitive. Six storms are ordered by degree of intensity: the combative and aggressive Thor, the all-night rumbler Odin, the adventurous and fascinating journey of Aegir, and the magical and mystical forest of Loki, as well as two rain-only tracks that are perfect for a sleeping ambience. Thundergod contains an album's worth of audio, but it actually feels much longer due to the seamless and infinite looping that Naturespace is known for. Providing both entertainment and function, Thundergod is the Swiss army knife of thunderstorm apps. It's the one app you will keep coming back to because, in the end, it's all about the audio quality.","2020-07-16","2024-01-18","15","0","0","0","0","15","15","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","iOS","Payment","Offline, Spanish","Track Sleep, Goal Setting/Habits","","Social Network, Notifications, Summary of Data","Sleep","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Device","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts, User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges)","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thundergod-insomnia-relief/id331385565","","","jane.stanga@gmail.com","bdwyer@bidmc.harvard.edu","1594933501309","1705613721683"

The app has 5 distinct sections that include: Screening; Assessment; Treatment; Medication Chart; and Risks and Benefits of Meds.  The app does not provide individualized medical recommendations, but presents evidence-based guidelines that specifically address the mental health needs of perinatal women. Screening allows providers to enter the depression screen score (from the EPDS – the depression screen used by most obstetric providers) and then be taken to Assessment, which helps providers understand different screen scores, details severity of symptoms, provides possible talking points about how to explain screen to patients, and suggest possible treatment options.  Treatment maps out a range of evidence-based treatment options including Self Care, Support Groups, Therapy, and Medication.  In each section, there is the possibility of using Talking Points to help providers know how to talk about mental health issues and concerns with their patients.  Before accessing the Medication Chart, providers are taken through a Bipolar Disorder Screen (2-3 questions), as this is best practice before considering medication for depression.  Providers will then navigate through a series of questions based on patients current medication practices (e.g., are they currently taking an antidepressant; do they have a history of taking antidepressants).  Providers will then have access to information that describes best practices for first (SSRI) and second line treatment strategies, as well as information re: starting doses, strategies to increase meds, therapeutic range, side effects of meds, and next steps based on clinical improvement vs. no clinicial improvement.  There is also access to additional resources.","2023-01-26","2024-01-15","4","0","0","0","0","4","4","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Psychoeducation, Identify New Conditions","Surveys","References/Information","Perinatal Depression","","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","Academic Institution","Assessments/Screenings","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lifeline4moms/id1365668000","","","sperret@bu.edu","sdl182201@gmail.com","1674749377871","1705296961001"

With body image in our culture being on the forefront of our minds, it is no surprise that not people realize that this is a problem and can be highly addicting. Anorexia Nervosa Help Calendar can help you put an end to your anorexia addiction by holding you accountable, offering solutions, words of encouragement, and science based facts that will help you get past your anorexia nervosa.\n \nFeatures:\n1.

Change the look and feel of the app with our skins section to personalize the app to what you want.\n4. Add reasons why you would like to see yourself succeed and stop anorexia.\n5.

Our distractions section will help you take your mind off of anorexia and introduce you to something more positive and soothing.\n8. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake anorexia.\n \nAnorexia is characterized by a distorted body image, with an unwarranted fear of being overweight. Symptoms include trying to maintain a below-normal weight through starvation or too much exercise. Medical treatment may be needed to restore normal weight. Download this free app to help you overcome. \n \nHere are our top 8 reasons to say no to anorexia:\n \n1. Stop feeling isolated from others\n \nIt is not easy to explain to others why you aren’t eating. Anorexia keeps you in a bubble, and that cannot be a good thing. Social experience is a part of being human, and when you start isolating yourself for being anorexic, you experience emotional and physical pain.\n \n2. Malnutrition is a big issue\n \nMalnutrition happens when your body is deprived of essential calories and nutrients that you need to survive. The constant food restriction of anorexia makes your body malnourished and more prone to illnesses and disease.\n \n3. Anorexic dehydration\n \nMild dehydration will cause dry skin, head rushes, chills, and weakness. More serious dehydration will lead to increased heart rate and heavier breathing. If you let it go any farther than this, you will be at risk for cardiac arrest, seizures, and even unconsciousness.\n \n4. Anorexia makes you lose hair\n \nThe lack of nutrients entering your body forces your body to condense its functional responses. Anything that your body feels unnecessary for survival will start to get less nutrients. This starts with your hair. Your hair may thin or start falling out. \n \n5. Random thin hairs will start growing on your body\n \nYour body must compensate for the lack of insulation that your body provides, so in a last ditch attempt to save your internal temperature; you will start growing thin hairs on your face and in other unwanted areas of the body.\n \n6. Anorexia makes your fingernails brittle\n \nThis goes back to the lack of nutrition flowing through your body. Your fingernails are not an essential part of your body when you are not getting enough nutrients, so your body will shut down the flow of nutrients to your nails.\n \n7. You could become infertile!\n \nBody fat is essential for menstruation. Not only will you lose your ability to become pregnant, but you will also stop having your period. Some may see this as a perk, but extended periods of this will lead to permanent infertility. \n \n8. Bone loss\n \nWith anorexia, bones become more brittle because of the lack of nutrient delivery. This will lead to having weaker bones and increase the chances of your bones breaking. \n \n \nDownload Anorexia Nervosa Help Calendar now for FREE and help get rid of anorexia once and for all!","2021-06-10","2023-11-07","11","0","0","0","0","11","11","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android, iOS","Free to Download, Payment, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Offline, Email or Export Your Data, Accessibility","Goal Setting/Habits, Picture Gallery/Hope Board, Journaling","Diary, Surveys","Notifications, Reminders, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data, Social Network","Eating Disorders","Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Is PHI Shared","Self Help","Patient Facing, Does What it Claims, Well Written Relevant Content","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges), Network Support","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anorexia-nervosa-help-calendar/id1112384574","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AnorexiaHelp.Calendar&hl=en_US&gl=US","","tolear01@tufts.edu","eperlmut@bidmc.harvard.edu","1623347207930","1699384787039"

The knee is composed of two joints: the tibiofemoral joint, between the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone), and the patellofemoral joint, between the femur and patella (knee cap). Each is an anchor point for multiple tendons, fascia, and other structures, including the IT band. If you have bad biomechanics, typically caused by a muscle imbalance, especially weak glutes, repetitive movement can irritate structures in the knee and lead to what is broadly known as anterior knee pain—a catchall category for general pain in the front of the knee.  \nThe stabilizer muscles for the knee, counterintuitively, are in the hips. When those muscles are weak or imbalanced, they can’t keep your knee properly aligned. “If you’re not able to control the position of your leg as your foot makes contact with the ground, pedal, or rock, it can result in increased stress to the structures of the knee. To further complicate the issue, once the pain signals your brain that there’s a problem, this can lead to further compensations in response to the irritation, which can shut off key muscles and tighten up other structures.\n\n Explanation of all the muscles that need to be strengthened and why: \n\n\nQuadriceps.\n\nThey cover the front of the thigh, cross the kneecap and form a tendon known as the patellar tendon. The quadriceps muscles allow you to extend or straiten the knee. If there is a weakness or tightness in the quadriceps you will get pain and stress in the joint as you go upstairs or get up from a chair.\n\nHip adductor muscles.\n\nHip Adductors allow you to adduct your leg or bring it to the midline of the body. They help to stabilise the hip joint and help maintain the body in a stationary position.\n\nHip flexor muscles.\n\nHip Flexor muscles allow you to flex your hip. Hip Flexor muscles come from the spine and the pelvis and attach to the upper thigh bone. If the hip flexors are tight or weak they can pull the thigh out of its proper alignment. This in turn pulls the kneecap out of its groove causing knee pain.\n\nHamstring muscles.\n\nHamstring muscles allow you to bend the knee and also extend your hip. Most importantly strong hamstring muscles will help you protect a very important ligament called the ACL.\n\nGastrocnemius muscle.\n\nPeople with weak calf muscles often complain of pain in the front of the knee around the patellar tendon area.\n\nGluteus medius.\n\nGluteus medius allows you to perform activities including hip abduction and hip external rotation. When you’re walking you’re only on one foot at any given time. The Gluteus medius help you to stabilise your pelvis. If it’s weak you get a drop in your hip and that causes stress on the knee.\n\nGluteus maximus.\n\nIt allows you to extend your hip and externally rotate your hip. If the Gluteus maximus muscles are weak other muscles in the back of the leg tend to take over and you end up with overly active hamstrings and tight hamstrings lead to knee pain.","2021-06-21","2023-09-22","6","0","0","0","0","6","6","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","","Geolocation","References/Information","Pain","App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Data Stored on Server, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Reference, Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Videos","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eurowall.kneepain_physicaltherapyexercises","","qhossai000@citymail.cuny.edu","eperlmut@bidmc.harvard.edu","1624257625493","1695403932654"

You feel dizzy, confused and disoriented right after drinking a lot of alcohol. The next day, you feel groggy and may have a headache. Other common physical side effects of alcohol include nausea, vomiting and low body temperature.\n\n- Harm to the brain \n- Headaches \n- Tiredness \n- Nausea \n- Vomiting\n- Low Body temperature \n\nThese effects are symptoms of the internal damage that alcohol causes. Vital organs and other internal parts of the body can recover from infrequent, moderate drinking. But the regular binge drinking and heavy drinking that often accompany alcohol addiction can cause long-term damage that lowers your quality of life. Drinking this way increases your chances of developing numerous alcohol-related diseases.\n\nFortunately, the body can usually bounce back if you quit drinking. Recovery from liver damage may even be possible. You may not realize that alcohol is hurting your everyday health until you quit drinking and start to feel better.\n\n\nPhysical Benefits of Abstaining from Alcohol :\n\nThe most noticeable physical benefits of sobriety occur in the brain. Depending on how much you’re used to drinking, these can occur fairly quickly.\n\n- Focus\n- Problem Solving \n- Critical Thinking\n- Memory \n\nCutting back on alcohol intake may help you lose weight. It can also help improve nutritional deficiencies related to drinking. Quitting alcohol can also lower your risk of developing different cancers.\n\n- Liver Cancer Prevention\n- Esophagus cancer Prevention\n- Breast cancer Prevention\n- Pharynx cancer Prevention\n- Mouth cancer Prevention\n\nAbstaining from alcohol allows your body’s natural defenses to operate at full strength and protect you from disease.\n\nQuitting alcohol can help you recover from many mental health ailments. \n\n- Longer and deeper sleep\n- Anxiety relief\n- Stabilized mood\n- Depression relief\n\nDrinking too much alcohol can lead to embarrassing moments and regrettable situations. People who overdrink or drink too often are more likely to experience problems in other parts of life.\n\n- Greater academic success \n- Fewer financial and legal problems\n- Improved relationships\n- Increased confidence in yourself\n\nMany people don’t notice that alcohol is impacting other parts of their life. They may not realize that they’re spending less time with friends or family because they’re recovering from a hangover. Or they may not recognize that sluggishness at work or school is related to drinking the night before.\n\nIn the earliest alcoholic recovery stages, alcoholics may also rationalize their drinking or deny that there’s an issue — even when all signs point to a problem.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nSober - Stop Drinking Alcohol is more than just a free sobriety assistance app, it guides you through the way and helps you achieve the freedom that you have always wanted !\n\nSTOP DRINKING ALCOHOL RIGHT NOW ! and say a big and loud NO to it ... \n\nThis app is then your best buddy in this voyage, download it right now and start enjoying the benefits of being SOBER.","2022-05-22","2023-09-02","7","0","0","0","0","7","7","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","iOS","Free to Download, Payment, In-App Purchase","Accessibility, Offline","Psychoeducation, Journaling","Diary, Geolocation, Microphone","References/Information","Substance Use (Alcohol)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Device, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Assessments/Screenings, Videos, Audio/Music/Scripts, User Generated Data","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sober-stop-drinking-alcohol/id1515250696","","","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","megan_list@brown.edu","1653190313786","1693667793811"

The disorders include anorexia nervosa (voluntary starvation), bulimia nervosa (binge-eating followed by purging), binge-eating disorder (binge-eating without purging), and unspecified eating disorders (disordered eating that does not fit into another category). \n\nWhat you will learn:\n    • What Are Eating Disorders?\n    • How Eating Disorders Begin\n    • Anorexia\n    • Bulimia\n    • Binge Eating\n    • In Their Own Words\n    • Anorexia Rates\n    • More on Eating Disorders\n    • Emotional Avoidance and Eating Disorders\n    • Portrait of a Binge Eater\n    • Meditation Helps Eating Disorder Recovery\n    • Weighing The Evidence For Psychotherapy\n\nEating disorders occur frequently—but not exclusively—in affluent cultures. A disproportionate number of those diagnosed are young women in their teens and 20s, but anyone, including young men and older adults, can develop an eating disorder at any age. Among the most baffling of conditions, eating disorders take on a life of their own so that eating, or not eating, becomes the focus of everyday existence.\n\nBiological factors, social pressure, and family history and dynamics are some of the factors associated with eating disorders. Culturally mediated body-image concerns and personality traits like perfectionism and obsessiveness also play a large role in eating disorders, which are often accompanied by depression and/or anxiety.\n\nTreatment is never simple for these conditions. They often create multiple medical problems and can even be acutely life-threatening, requiring hospitalization and forced nourishment. It can take a multidisciplinary team of health professionals, including a psychotherapist, a medical doctor, and a specialized dietitian or nutritionist to bring about full recovery in someone with an eating disorder.\n\nMade with love by Subject Mastery Academy","2021-06-14","2023-08-18","9","0","0","0","0","9","9","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Psychoeducation","","References/Information","Eating Disorders","App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Data Stored on Device, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev601172.app1051089&hl=en_US&gl=US","","tolear01@tufts.edu","eperlmut@bidmc.harvard.edu","1623707395282","1692367786851"

Backed by a decade of NIH-supported clinical research, this mobile game rewires subconscious habits of thinking to reduce stress and anxiety.* It just takes a few minutes a day, 4 days a week! Based on your current stress levels, a daily goal of gameplay is recommended (typically between 6-10 minutes). Then, you can choose from a number of different game regions and start playing to meet your daily goal. It’s that simple!\nIn addition to gameplay, you can also access brief, science-backed tools to support your mental health journey including:\n-Journaling & mood tracking to help identify feelings and triggers\n-Breathing exercises to calm anxiety and improve sleep\n-Mindfulness practices to regulate emotions and reduce stress\n\n*Safety and efficacy claims have not been evaluated by the FDA. Personal Zen is available via the Enforcement Discretion Policy introduced by the FDA in April 2020, allowing computerized behavioral therapies for anxiety disorders to be commercially distributed without a 510(k) premarket notification and a prescription.\n\n\nHOW DO I USE PERSONAL ZEN?\nStart by completing a daily check-in and tune into your stress and mood. The check-in helps determine your personalized goal for game play. To use Personal Zen, look for the sparkle to follow the friendly sprite (the smiling face) after it disappears. Don't try to capture the friendly sprite. Simply tap on the sparkle quickly, then smoothly trace the path left in its wake. A “medallion” will appear, telling you where to focus your attention next. Don’t let the angry sprite divert your focus from finding the sparkle. It’s natural to sometimes trace the path a couple of times to achieve accuracy. Play until reaching your goal for the day.\n\nDo a mood check-in or visit the Positive Practices area to take a few minutes to review tips and tools for reducing stress and anxiety from Dr. Tracy, creator of Personal Zen. Personal Zen offers science-based tools, like breathing exercises, musical therapy, and journaling, among other tips that help better manage stress and anxiety.\n\nHOW DOES PERSONAL ZEN WORK?\nDuring gameplay, angry and happy sprites briefly appear then disappear. You are then prompted to trace the trail left by the happy sprite. During gameplay, you might notice that your attention draws to the angry sprite instead of the happy sprite. This is called ‘threat bias’ - a subconscious habit of attention that drives you to focus on negative information at the expense of the positive. Threat bias acts like an information filter that distorts your ability to cope with anxiety, sparking vicious cycles of distress and worry. By playing the game, we change this habit and shift your threat bias to focus more on the positive, rather than the negative. Personal Zen helps to short-circuit these negative habits of attention and allows the user to develop a more flexible and positive focus.\n\nBrief training with Personal Zen can even reduce your body’s stress response! Our studies show that using the app 6-10 minutes a day, 4 days a week reduces levels of stress hormones known as cortisol, and reduces anxiety.\n\nImprove your stress resilience and reduce anxiety today - try the app free for 30 days!\n\nHERE’S WHAT EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY HAD TO SAY ABOUT PERSONAL ZEN:\n\n“Personal Zen brings cutting-edge research and well-established strategies for reducing anxiety and stress into the palm of your hand.”\nDr. Shannon M. Bennett, Assistant Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry, Weill Cornell Medical College\n\n\n“Instantly engaging for adults and kids, Personal Zen is a rare example of science turned into fun in order to reduce stress and anxiety.”\nDr. Tony Simon, Professor of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis\n\n\nWe respect your privacy.

I bought a new iPhone to be able to use it. DBT skills are priceless. I had tried every, other DBT and CBT app. This one follows the traditional DBT program exactly, and is the only Diary Card. Before I had this app, I'd seldom fill in my diary card. Now that I have it, I don't have to keep track of paper, and I rarely miss a day. I can fill in my Diary Card discreetly, from anywhere, anytime, and send it directly to my DBT coach. I no longer have to worry about someone coming across my Diary Cards. You can brush up on skills, use it for distress tolerance suggestions, tailor it to your needs, and even journal. I appreciate that I can add personal goals to my diary.

Mental health professionals in private or group practices can use PsychSurveys to administer customizable diary cards/tracking sheets as well as valid and reliable mental health surveys to their patients to measure distress levels and track patient progress over time. PsychSurveys was developed in partnership with psychologists who are intensively trained in cognitive and dialectical behavior therapies. It improves client care by allowing you to objectively measure your clients' symptoms and use the results to highlight progress or identify areas needing further intervention.\n\nSimply choose which survey(s) you wish to have your patient(s) complete and how often. Patients can use either the mobile app for alerts and completion of surveys at home or while in session, or they can receive email alerts with links to complete surveys using a web browser on a PC or mobile device.  Patients can opt out of the email alerts at any time simply by clicking the link in the email to opt out.\n\nIf patients use the mobile app, they'll see reminders and alerts on their iPhone or iPad when surveys are due and a badge icon indicating how many surveys are due.\n\nAs surveys are completed, they are automatically scored.  Each patient's progress is tracked over time for each applicable survey.  The reports include all relevant scales and sub-scales and you can drill down to see how the patient responded to the questions in the surveys for each time they completed a survey.\n\nWe offer 142 pre-configured surveys: \n\nAnxiety: AAI, AAQ-OC, ASQ-2, BDD-YBOCS, CAPS, CY-BOCS, DASS-21, DOCS, FASA, GAD-2, GAD-7, HAI-18, ITQ, ITQ-CA, K-GSADS-A, LSAS, MGH-HPS, Mini-SPIN, MIST-A, OASIS, OCI-4, OCI-12, OCI-R, OBQ-44, PCL-5, PCL-Child, PCL-Civilian, PDSS-SR, PSS-I-5, PSWQ, PSWQ-C, PTCI, SCARED-C, SCARED-P, SCI-R, SI-R, SIAS, SMSP-A, SMSP-C, SOCS, SPIS, SPIN, SPOVI, SPS-R, TRS, TSC-C, TSC-P, Y-BOCS, ZSAS\n\nBorderline Personality Disorder: BEST, BSL-23, DBT-WCCL, ISAS, LPI, MSI-BPD, BPFSC-11\n\nRelationship Satisfaction: BARE, CSI\n\nMood Disorders: ATQ, BADS-SF, BDI, BRFL-A, BRFL-12, CES-DC, CORE-10, DAS-SF1, DAS-SF2, DASS-21, DSRS-C, EPDS, GDS, PHQ-2, PHQ-9, PHQ-A, QIDS-SR16, RRS-SF-10, USSIS, WSAS, WSASY, ZSDS\n\nEating Disorders: ED-15, EDE-Q, EDE-QS, EDQOL, IES-2, PVA, SCOFF, YFAS\n\nEmotion Dysregulation: AAQ-2, ASRM, DERS, DERS-18\n\nSubstance Abuse: AUDIT, BAM, DrInC, InDUC-M, SDS, SIP-R, URICA\n\nTherapeutic Relationship: CALPAS-P, CHS, HAq-II, MHCS\n\nClinician Surveys: EBPPAS, ProQOL\n\nOthers: 6-PAQ, ADNM-20, AEX, AHS, ASRS, AAQ, B-MEAQ, Brief COPE, BRS, C-SSRS, CFQ, DAR-5, DES-II, DHEQ, FAD, FFMQ-15, FMPS, FMPS-B, FS, IPS, ISI, MHC-SF, PQ-LES-Q, PBQ, PSQI, PSS, PTQ, Q-LES-Q-SF, SAPAS, SCS, SRAS-R, UPPS-P, PANAS-C, PANAS-C-P, PNS, PSC, VQ, Y-PSC\n\nDiary Cards are a tool to help patients track emotions, urges, and behaviors on a daily basis. This aids clinicians in identifying their patients areas of struggle over the course of the week to more effectively prioritize session time and identify points for intervention. The diary card also functions as a tool for increasing awareness of emotions and urges for clients, as well as helping them identify Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills they could use in moments of distress. When patients complete Diary Cards, the results are available for viewing instantly. There is no need for patients to email their diary cards to you each week. This feature is fully customizable and could be used as tracking sheets focusing on emotions, urges, and behaviors for Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) based interventions as well.\n\nWith PsychSurveys, patients do not need to email you their results from surveys and diary cards - the results are available to you in real-time automatically.  In addition, setting up surveys and diary cards for patients is quick, simple, and centralized.","2023-07-02","2023-07-02","1","0","0","0","1","0","1","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Own Your Own Data, Email or Export Your Data, Send Your Data to a Medical Record","Track Mood, Psychoeducation, Identify New Conditions","Surveys, Diary","Notifications, References/Information, Reminders, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data","Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Meets HIPAA, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Can Opt Out of Data Collection","Reference, Hybrid","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Assessments/Screenings, Collaborative With Provider/Other","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/psychsurveys/id1323768599","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psychsurveys.psychsurveys&hl=en_US&gl=US","https://www.psychsurveys.com/","kaitlynr@bu.edu","kaitlynr@bu.edu","1688329622618","1688329622618"

All you have to do is select the right answer more times than not, and you will be moved onto the next level instantly. Each round you pass will offer a description of why the answer is the way it is.\n\n  For example:\n  Level 3: In this scenario, are you practicing Wise Mind, or not?\n    - Scenario: Whenever your spouse makes you mad, you show your anger because if you don't, you aren't being true to yourself.\n    - Answer: Not Wise Mind\n    - Why: There is a myth among some people that says that if they don't express how they feel, that they aren't being true to themselves. This however neglects the fact that we all say things we regret saying when we are angry. Therefore, generally speaking, it would not be wise to show your anger every time you feel it. There of course are times when it is appropriate. Usually though, it is better to calm down and get into a Wise Mind state of mind before choosing what to do about that situation that made you angry.\n\n  Now with over 450 DBT Questions from all 4 DBT Skill Groups:\n  • Mindfulness Skills\n  • Interpersonal Communication Skills\n  • Distress Tolerance Skills\n  • Emotional Regulation Skills\n\n  And as usual, this app integrates with our other DBT apps.

People who have bipolar disorder can have periods in which they feel overly happy and energized and other periods of feeling very sad, hopeless, and sluggish. In between those periods, they usually feel normal. You can think of the highs and the lows as two \poles\ of mood, which is why it's called \bipolar\ disorder.\n\nIn bipolar disorder, the dramatic episodes of high and low moods do not follow a set pattern.

People have the right to be angry, happy, sad and all those behaviors. Although, when one experiences the disease, it will be most unlikely that the person will show a condition that had become tragically habitual. Typically, there are four episodes that a person will engage into if he or she suffers from the disorder. These episodes are:\n\n1. Major Depressive Episode\n\nSomeone who is experiencing a major depressive episode in his or her life expresses symptoms like:\n\n• persistent emotional feelings of anxiety, anger, sadness, guilt, isolation and hopelessness • indifference, apathy or self-loathing • appetite and sleep disturbances • fatigue and extreme restlessness • unable to become interested in usually enjoyable activities • depersonalization and extreme loneliness • lack of interest in having sexual activities • social anxiety and shyness • chronic pain that usually triggers irritability • suicidal tendencies or morbid thinking\n\nIn worst case scenarios, most especially if the person suffering from the disorder never had the opportunity to go into psychological help, he can become psychotic which is also known as a severe condition of the disease.\n\n2. Manic Episode\n\nMajor characteristics of people who experiences manic episodes are those that have a distinct condition of expansive, irritable or elevated mood state. Someone who suffers manic episodes experience a common insurmountable amount of energy but lacks the capability to get proper sleep.\n\nFurthermore, the speech of the person is pressured in a way that even thoughts are racing. Attention span is decreased and can be easily distracted. Impairment of judgment can also be experienced whereas the sufferer will undergo sprees and abnormal behavior that is quite unusual on his or her part.\n\nIndulging in substance abuse can also be possible. Substances may include depressant drugs, stimulants, and even sleeping pills. Behavior may range from being intrusive or aggressive. Grandiose and delusional ideas may become prominent. During extremes, a person may exhibit psychosis which is a factor that perceives fantasy more than reality.\n\n3. Hypomanic Episode\n\nThis is the lesser part of mania episode. Extremes are less prominent. Symptoms and attitudes are also decreased. When a person experiences a hypomanic episode, he would feel sudden uncontrollable behavior like laughing out loud even with no specific reason behind it or there might be a reason but it would be shallow.\n\nDuration of the episode occurs only for a short period of time. Oftentimes, this is associated with the artistic mind of the person involved because intelligent thinking, flight of ideas, and an abnormal increase in energy can be seen.\n\n4. Mixed Episode\n\nMixed episodes usually refer to the combined state of depressive episodes and manic episodes that may occur simultaneously. Some of which are experiencing impulsiveness, racing thoughts, rage, agitation, paranoia, aggressiveness, etc.\n\nIt is better that one understands the different episodes a bipolar disorder expresses in order to diagnose the disease earlier and treatment can be performed.","2022-06-28","2023-06-29","5","0","0","0","2","3","5","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Psychoeducation","","References/Information","Mood Disorders, Bipolar Disorder","","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bipolardisorder.com.blogspot.codedeveloped.bipolardisorder&hl=en_US&gl=US","","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","bdwyer@bidmc.harvard.edu","1656444622917","1688046547607"

CBT is effective and commonly used for a variety of mental health concerns. ‘C’ is for cognitive and refers to what and how we think. ‘B’ is for behavioral or how we act. Cognitive-Behavioral is about the relationship between our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\n\nThose thoughts, emotions, and behaviours connect to our moods, our physical experiences, and events in our lives. Being aware of how negative thoughts about an event or experience might be affecting how we act, or perceive a situation, can change our emotional, behavioural and physical responses to it.\n\nMorneau Shepell’s AbilitiCBT is CBT delivered by a therapist through an app. Combining a personalized therapist-guided program with digital tools and exercises to bring CBT to life wherever and whenever needed.\n\nMobile access. Therapy that meets you where you are.\n\nDigital therapy means easy access available 24/7 from any mobile device making it easy to incorporate therapy into your daily life without the additional time and travel requirements of in-person therapy.\n\nSupported by a trained CBT therapist\n\nEvery program includes a dedicated CBT therapist who will review all of the work and activities in the program. The therapist will guide the treatment plan accordingly, which may mean suggesting new activities or revisiting modules.

Whether you’re an occasional teen smoker or a lifetime pack-a-day smoker, quitting can be really tough.\nTo successfully stop smoking, you’ll need to address both the addiction and the habits and routines that go along with it. But it can be done. With the right support and quit plan, any smoker can kick the addiction—even if you’ve tried and failed multiple times before.\n\nStart your stop smoking plan with START\nS = Set a quit date.\n\nChoose a date within the next two weeks, so you have enough time to prepare without losing your motivation to quit. If you mainly smoke at work, quit on the weekend, so you have a few days to adjust to the change.\n\nT = Tell family, friends, and co-workers that you plan to quit.\n\nLet your friends and family in on your plan to quit smoking and tell them you need their support and encouragement to stop. Look for a quit buddy who wants to stop smoking as well. You can help each other get through the rough times.\n\nA = Anticipate and plan for the challenges you’ll face while quitting.\n\nMost people who begin smoking again do so within the first three months. You can help yourself make it through by preparing ahead for common challenges, such as nicotine withdrawal and cigarette cravings.\n\nR = Remove cigarettes and other tobacco products from your home, car, and work.\n\nThrow away all of your cigarettes, lighters, ashtrays, and matches. Wash your clothes and freshen up anything that smells like smoke. Shampoo your car, clean your drapes and carpet, and steam your furniture.\n\nT = Talk to your doctor about getting help to quit.\n\nYour doctor can prescribe medication to help with withdrawal symptoms. If you can’t see a doctor, you can get many products over the counter at your local pharmacy, including nicotine patches, lozenges, and gum.","2021-07-22","2023-06-02","5","0","0","0","0","5","5","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Journaling, Picture Gallery/Hope Board, Goal Setting/Habits, Track Symptoms","Diary, Camera","References/Information, Summary of Data","Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","Has Privacy Policy, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is PHI Shared, Data Stored on Server, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eracox.stopsmoking&hl=en_US&gl=US","","klara.aastroem@yale.edu","sperret@bu.edu","1626984269628","1685716214265"

Make this space your own by filling it with thoughts, ideas, worries, concerns, feelings, hopes and dreams. Use it knowing that anything you don’t want to keep inside your mind - HOLD will hold it for you.\n\nOften people cannot engage properly with things that are on their mind because it might be hard or confusing, it may take the time they don’t have or it may seem like a waste of time.

It offers an extensive collection of engaging information and clinically-validated therapeutic exercises.  Relaxation training, education, lifestyle modification, trigger management, sleep hygiene, and other non-pharmaceutical modalities can improve health and well-being for those experiencing migraine attacks. With as little as 10 minutes of relaxation training a day, Ease has been shown to decrease monthly headache and migraine days by up to 60%, but as with physical exercise, any amount you do will help.\n\n\n\nYou will learn about causes of headaches and migraines, common triggers, available treatment options, tips & tricks for avoiding attacks, and what to do when you feel an attack coming. Ease also guides you through a recommended series of informative educational sessions and therapeutic exercises. The goal is to incorporate Ease into your daily routine as part of a personalized pain management plan.\n\n\nAnother important Easeday feature is HRVY. HRVY is Easeday’s heart rate variability (HRV) sensing feature to measure your resilience to stress. HRV has become the most scientifically accepted way to follow your relaxation response in real time. Watch your HRV score increase as you practice therapeutic breathing exercises.  Over weeks and months, you can see your HRV scores improve with regular Easeday relaxation training. \n\n\nThe higher the HRV score the better. Higher HRV scores correlate with increased resilience to stress, improved cardiovascular health and a longer life span.  Lower HRV scores correlate with decreased resilience to stress, chronic pain, and depression. For good reason, health-conscious people today are incorporating a daily relaxation exercise into their personal wellness strategy to complement their physical conditioning routine. \n\n\nIn addition, Easeday provides an easy-to-use headache diary for tracking headache and migraine events. You can record symptoms, triggers, medication usage, and the impact on your life.\n\nYou will also receive personalized guidance and insights to help identify patterns and changes that you can make to reduce the chance of having a future headache or migraine attack. You will be able to see your progress and improvement over time, learn what triggers may affect you the most, and see how you are keeping up with your daily goals and training.\n\n\nRelaxation exercises include:\n\n\n*Breathing\n*Meditation\n*Mindfulness\n*Sleep\n*Progressive Muscle Relaxation\n*Guided Imagery\n*Autogenics\n*Music\n*And more\n\n\nYou will find information on:\n\n\n*Headache and migraine disorders\n*Preventative treatments\n*Acute treatments\n*Rescue plans\n*Complementary treatments\n*Insomnia\n*Chronic Pain\n*Fatigue\n*Anxiety\n*Tinnitus\n*Facial Pain (TMJ Syndrome)\n*Neck & back pain\n*Dizziness\n*And many other related conditions\n\n\nThe Ease app integrates with the Health App.\n\nRemember to always seek a doctor’s advice in addition to using this app and before making any medical decisions\n\nSubscription pricing and terms:\n\n\nEase offers an auto-renewing subscription at $9.99/month or $59.99/year to provide you with unlimited access to the Ease library while you maintain an active subscription.\n\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your iTunes Account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase.

This is a truly USEFUL app, and the newest member of the My Pain Diary family, which has helped over 90,000 chronic pain sufferers better manage their pain, improve communication with their doctors, and gain insights that would be hard attain through other means.\n\nUseful and popular features include automatic weather fetching, iCloud sync, basic medication tracking, photo attachments, graphs and PDF doctor's reports.\n\nThis app is highly customizable. Everyone tracks pain differently, and this is a framework that supports just about any tracking strategy.\n\nCreated by a chronic pain patient to track, manage, and report on chronic pain and symptoms, chronic illness, and mental health.\n\nThat means there is no big company with deep pockets supporting this project. I am just one man with a chronic pain condition, a demanding day job, and a young family to care for. I just happen to be formally trained in design, self-taught in programming, experienced at marketing and customer relations, and am a chronic pain patient myself. That's a very rare combination of traits that is hard to come by, so I'm making the most of it, and holding my own against the big players.\n\nEnough about me, back to the app!\n\nFeatures:\n+   iCloud Sync Support\n+   Universal App\n+   Highly Customizable\n+   Easy to use \n+   Track unlimited conditions\n+   Track multiple/unlimited times per day\n+   Add past entries (change entry timestamp)\n+   Edit past entries\n\nANATOMY OF A PAIN DIARY ENTRY\n\nTRACKERS: Trackers can be thought of as labels or folders that categorize and differentiate your entries. These are the key to tracking more than one condition and comparing conditions to each other.\n\nA common strategy is to name the Trackers after the diseases/conditions that you will be tracking. I.e. Migraines, Anxiety, Fibromyalgia, etc. These are just examples. \n\nMETRICS: Each entry is composed of one or more optional pieces of information called 'Metrics'. For example, two commonly used metrics are 'Pain Intensity' and 'Pain Duration'. Metrics are associated with and shared amongst your Trackers. This means that you can set it up to use different metrics for different Trackers, keeping your entry pages clean and the cognitive load low.\n\n -- MEDICATION TRACKING --\n+   Basic medication tracking.\n\n -- IMPORTANT EVENTS --\n+   Record important events that aren't suited for a Pain Diary entry. i.e. Medical Procedures, Therapy Sessions, A slip and fall, etc.\n\n -- HISTORY --\n+    Color-Coded Calendar - Spot patterns and trends at a glance. Calendar days are colored based on the day's highest recorded Intensity.\n+   Fully searchable.\n+   Day View\n\n -- GRAPHS --\n+   Visualize and compare intensity over time with this interactive graph. Plot and compare up to 3 'Trackables' at once and one optional Weather Metric.\n+   Email, print and share a PDF of the Graph.\n\n -- REPORTS --\n+   Create a PDF Report for your Doctors or for archival purposes.

You’re out with friends, you pour, you sip, you get that warm, relaxed feeling, and that’s it.\n\nFor others, one glass becomes many, one night out becomes every night, and drinking starts taking up major mental space that becomes a focal point of your life.  \n\nIf you’re addicted to something, it doesn’t mean you’re weak or bad at willpower. Addiction lives in your brain circuitry — it’s not a personal shortcoming.\n\nAddictive substances like alcohol activate pleasure receptors in your brain. The more often you switch on your pleasure pathways, the less pleasure you feel over time. So, your brain will crave stronger and stronger stimuli to get those happy chemicals. Your brain grows accustomed to the stimulus after so much repetition, and over time you’re so used to it that you have to have your fix to function.\n\nWhether you’re starting a new habit or breaking an old one, success hinges upon three things:\n\nChanging your behavior – either starting a new behavior or stopping one\nWillpower – being physically and mentally resilient against weak moments and temptation\nOften you must change the way you see yourself in the world\nAlcohol addiction recovery is a whole different animal, but there is some overlap. Quitting drinking, specifically, has three distinct phases:\n\nDetox – get all of the nasty stuff that built up from years of drinking out of your system\nBecome abstinent\nStart the path of holistic recovery\nWith the understanding that you need all of these to work together, you can put together your plan to drop the bottle.\n\nMost people with alcohol problems do not decide to make a big change out of the blue or transform their drinking habits overnight. Recovery is usually a more gradual process. In the early stages of change, denial is a huge obstacle. Even after admitting you have a drinking problem, you may make excuses and drag your feet. It’s important to acknowledge your ambivalence about stopping drinking. If you’re not sure if you’re ready to change or you’re struggling with the decision, it can help to think about the costs and benefits of each choice.\n\nAvoid using the word ‘alcoholic’ due to the negative connections associated with this word. Instead, show you concerns by stressing the fact alcoholism is a disease that requires treatment.\n\nIf you feel you lack the ability to communicate your concerns in the manner, then another option is to stage a professional intervention. For a moderate fee, a professional interventionist will travel to your home in order to conduct this intervention.\n\nThis application feature are :-\n\nYou can bookmark Favorite articles(post)\n\nThis application helps you to read the article(post) - Once click 'Read Article' button, automatically read the page content(Text to Speech).\n\nYou can share the article(post) to your friends,family and social networks.\n\nYou can copy the text from any post.\n\nYou can enable notification\n\nYou can adjust font size(small, medium, big) of articles","2022-06-08","2022-12-08","4","0","0","0","0","4","4","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline, Accessibility","Psychoeducation","","Notifications, References/Information","Substance Use (Alcohol)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.howtostop.drinking&hl=en_US&gl=US","","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","nalon@bidmc.harvard.edu","1654716786094","1670517333340"

This can cause recurring negative thoughts which lead to negative feelings, and behaviors. During this novel game, the player, the Lion in a jungle story, helps Fish, Monkey, Panther and other animals understand their daily experiences and practice generating more positive or helpful  thoughts in upsetting circumstances which can lead to more positive feelings and more adaptive behaviors.\n\nThe game is accessible on iPad and Android tablets. It can potentially help any player better understand the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and develop strategies to improve their lives.\n\nFeedback from users:\n\n“The Triangle of Life app has been a valuable tool to teach kids the building blocks of CBT in an engaging, interactive way. My patients enjoy playing this game, and more importantly, are more easily able to understand how to examine and challenge their negative thoughts. “\n\n“The Triangle of Life game is an easily accessible and highly entertaining tool for teaching children about cognitive processing.  Children readily identify with the animals in the game and quickly learn that the way they think about their situations makes a difference in how they feel and behave.  The game also shows children how negative thoughts can be challenged and replaced with thoughts that are more accurate and helpful.   I enthusiastically recommend the game to any therapist who has ever wondered how to make cognitive processing more relevant and fun for their young clients.”\n\nTF-CBT Triangle of Life received an honorable mention in the United Nations PEACEapp competition: http://www.unaoc.org/peaceapp-blog/peaceapp-winners-announced/\n\nFor details on how to become certified in TF-CBT: https://tfcbt.org/","2020-05-22","2022-10-24","8","0","0","0","6","2","8","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","Android, iOS, Web","Totally Free, Free to Download","Offline","Psychoeducation","","References/Information","PTSD","","Reference","Does What it Claims, Well Written Relevant Content, Patient Facing","Healthcare Company, Academic Institution","Gamification (Points/Badges), Audio/Music/Scripts, Videos","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tf-cbt-triangle-of-life/id978441894","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AHN.ETC.TriangleOfLife&hl=en","https://tfcbt.org/tf-cbt-triangle-of-life/","","ngocjune@gmail.com","1590162686943","1666573272573"

Cove is trusted by doctors and therapists as a safe and secure way to look after your mental health.\n\nEASY TO USE\n• First SCROLL pick a mood that helps you frame your mood\n• Then TAP to add chords, melody or even percussion\n• You can SWIPE to change instruments - there’s over 30 to choose from\n• Explore and be creative - there is no right or wrong way to make music!\n \nHOW IT WORKS\nWe believe Cove has a role to play in improving emotional and mental health by encouraging self-expression. We believe Cove is especially good if you experience anxiety or depression.\n \nCove can be used any time, but may be most useful when you find it difficult to express yourself through other means, such as talking or writing. You can use Cove whenever you feel like it. You can make music by yourself, or share what you make with others.\n  \nEVALUATED BY CLINICAL EXPERTS\nWe think it is important that any app that advertises about mental health takes it seriously.\n\nThat is why Cove has been tested, evaluated, and trialed in health services in the UK, and has been created in collaboration with clinicians and other specialists.\n \nCove primarily uses music instead of words to express a feeling or mood, and so it may be helpful in conjunction with talking therapies and counselling. Cove is not a substitute for professional therapy, and not suitable for those experiencing severe distress or suicidal thoughts. If you find yourself really struggling, in the app there are helpful links to organisations who can help you. Don't be afraid to reach out to someone.\n\nWHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT COVE\nCove helps me relax take a few minutes for myself on creating sounds that I can later hear again. Creating your own therapeutic music and save it in your own library!\n(Mer Wk)\n\nI use this app to help me when I am ruminating on something, especially negative things. I make a little Cove song about it and it makes my mind a little light, a little easier to move. I love the minimal, intuitive interface, and it provides an interesting array of sounds to play with. \n(Anknoif)\n \nReally enjoyed the ease with which I can capture an emotion I am feeling at the moment.\n(CMPSMKR)\n \nWHAT THE PRESS HAVE SAID\n...one of the best mental health apps.\n(The Guardian)\n\nCove is a journaling app that upends what you’d expect from a journaling app.\n(WIRED)\n \nFor people who struggle with anxiety or just find it hard to even determine their own moods, melodies can prove a useful tool of expression.\n(The Next Web)\n\nMADE WITH CARE\nWe all struggle with our mental health sometimes, some more than others. We made Cove because we’ve experienced problems in the past.

If cost is an option and you find yourself in need of pain relief in between medical and chiropractic appointments, however, it might be beneficial to try some simple exercises at home to get the blood flowing and those vertebrae moving.\n\nThese lower back strengthening exercises are a great way to strengthen your low back and your core in general. They also help strengthen your glutes, hamstrings, and other pelvic muscles.\n\nDoing these exercises regularly has proven to ease lower back pain and provide some relief from the stress that chronic pain can bring to your daily life. Practice these on a consistent basis, and you’ll be feeling better with each repetition.\n\nDo each of these exercises for 1 minute, emphasis on technique not speed! Take time to hold the positions and really work those muscles. Have a rest in between the sets.","2021-06-24","2022-10-14","4","0","0","0","0","4","4","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","","","","Pain","Has Privacy Policy, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help","Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Well Written Relevant Content","For Profit Company","","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newandromo.dev15276.app756196","","qhossai000@citymail.cuny.edu","nalon@bidmc.harvard.edu","1624495290590","1665775366889"

Have others expressed concern that your drinking may be out of control?  Are you ready to step away from old drinking habits? If you are like many people, getting a handle on a drinking problem has been very difficult, especially if you are trying to do it alone.  Step Away is here to help you through this process.\nStep Away brings the tools to make a positive change in you drinking easily and privately to your smartphone. Step Away will be your personal assistant as you go through the process of changing your drinking. It provides the structure you need to help you stop altogether or to reduce your drinking to safe levels. It will provide you with the tools and the accountability to make a positive change and stay with it. With Step Away, there is no need to wait until your next meeting with a counselor to receive helpful strategies and feedback on your progress while on your journey to a new relationship with alcohol. Immediate help will be right there on your smartphone.\nStep Away has been in development since 2013. It has been the focus of numerous grants from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Research has shown that it has helped people reduce their drinking by as much as 60% and that users indicated that it was very helpful in giving them helpful tools and keeping them on track.  Step Away is an empirically supported system that can help you take control of your drinking.\nStep Away will help you to privately and effectively:\n\n• Become more aware of your drinking patterns and triggers.\n\n• Set an overall drinking objective (to either stop drinking OR moderate your drinking) as well as smaller intermediate goals to help you succeed in stages.\n• Keep yourself accountable through continual feedback on your progress.\n\n• Stay in control when you are feeling tempted to drink by providing immediately available tools.\n\n• Learn new and helpful strategies for dealing with cravings, bad moods and boredom.\n\n• Keep you on track during your personally defined “high risk times” for drinking.\n\n• Remind yourself about your reasons for making a change when you are feeling like drinking or are in a tempting situation.\n\n• Share your progress with others (family, friends or health care provider).\n\n• Help you prepare for “high risk events” in the coming week - and strategically avoid alcohol triggers.\n\n• Identify alternate (non-drinking) activities and schedule them directly into your calendar.\nIf you choose to utilize Step Away, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you allow the app to send you alerts and notifications.  These are designed to keep you on track, particularly during times when you need help the most.","2022-06-10","2022-09-11","8","0","0","0","1","7","8","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","Android, iOS","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Accessibility, Offline","Track Symptoms, Psychoeducation, Goal Setting/Habits, Productivity","Surveys, Contact List, Microphone","Notifications, References/Information, Graphs of Data, Reminders, Summary of Data","Substance Use (Alcohol)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose","Self Help, Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Supporting Studies","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Assessments/Screenings, Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/step-away-alcohol-help/id688669242","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hereandnow.stepaway&hl=en_US&gl=US","","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","sdl182201@gmail.com","1654868727431","1662861439603"

This free App has been funded by the Swansea University Clinical Innovation Partnership (SHIPP), with money from the Welsh Government. \n\nApps currently available are aimed at helping people with established eating disorders to diary and chart diets, activity and moods. What is lacking are preventative and early intervention Apps for eating disorders aimed at members of the public. \n\nThis is an important gap - research suggests that both the public and primary health care professionals vary widely in understanding of and responses to eating disorders, with significant, costly delays in both seeking and receiving help; whereas early detection and intervention leads to better chances of recovery. In fact, the draft NICE guidance for Eating Disorders which will be published soon emphasises the importance of prompt and early diagnosis and referral for eating disorders. \n\nThe ‘Diet or Disorder?’ App is designed for and tested by both experts by experience and members of the public who are not familiar with eating disorders, as well as primary care health professionals. The App is made in Wales using UK standards but can be used in other countries. Its information is based on the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), Welsh Eating Disorder Framework, and adult and paediatric MARSIPAN (Management of Really Sick Patients with Anorexia Nervosa) guidelines. This is consistent with principles of the Mental Health (Wales) Measure 2010, Together For Children and Young People (Early Intervention and Enhanced Support), Making Sense report (2016) and Prudent Healthcare, that patients with mental disorders should be detected at earlier stages and receive appropriate and timely help in primary care. \n\nThe App is aimed at young people and their parents as well as adults and provides tools to support and empower sufferers and carers in a portable format. It has: a simple screening tool to help people to identify whether they or someone they care about may have an eating disorder; psychoeducation about eating disorders and their symptoms;\nsimple self-help strategies and links to resources; hints and tips for how to successfully seek help in primary care; and a single page format for presenting concerns to primary care professionals.","2021-06-14","2022-08-29","5","0","0","0","4","1","5","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline, Own Your Own Data","Track Symptoms, Psychoeducation","Surveys, Microphone","References/Information, Link to Formal Care/Coaching","Eating Disorders","","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning","Academic Institution, Government, Non-Profit Company","User Generated Data, Assessments/Screenings, Videos, Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/diet-or-disorder/id1220894592","","","tolear01@tufts.edu","nalon@bidmc.harvard.edu","1623677208879","1661787743740"

The program was developed and found effective in research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and was honored with the Excellence in Research on Military and Veteran Families Award for 2017 by the Military Family Research Institute at Purdue University. The research (a randomized controlled trial done in four cities with members of all branches of the military) found that both veterans and their partners experienced significant decreases in measures of PTSD, depression, stress levels, irritability, anxiety and pain, and significant increases in resilience and self-compassion.  \n\nUsers register for the program on the main website, and can access its instruction on both the website and the companion app to learn life-long wellness skills they can use at home. The program provides both video and audio instruction in 12 practices known to shift neurochemistry and ease pain. Practices taught include a set of mindfulness-related stress reduction and contemplative practices, as well as partner massage for reciprocal use. \n\nAs a self-directed program, users focus on strategies they find most beneficial. Veterans and their partners can use the practices individually and together at home. The Mission Reconnect research found benefits for both Veterans and their partners. Body, mind and spirit: Reduces stress, depression, tension, pain, irritability and sleep problems. Increases compassion, resiliency and interpersonal support.

Yet, giving your physician the correct data about your headaches is essential to getting the best headache care.\n\nLuckily, there’s help for you here.  iHeadache has everything you need to track your headache symptoms, disability, triggers and medications in a pain-free way.  With iHeadache, your iPhone becomes a headache diary that’s going to help you and your doctor diagnose and treat your pain.\n\niHeadache was developed by neurologist, researcher and headache specialist, Dr. Brian D. Loftus.  Who better than a specialist to create the most accurate and important headache tracking tool available?\n\nOne of the unique features of iHeadache is that it can tell you the type of headache you’re having by capturing and analyzing real time information.  The app uses criteria specified by the International Headache Society to classify your headache as a migraine, probable migraine, tension headache or unclassified headache.  This application is like having a doctor in your device.\n\nWhat kind of information does iHeadache track, record and analyze?\n• Symptoms \n• Duration and severity\n• Disability and impact \n• Medication and usage\n• Number of headaches\n• Headache triggers\n\nThe app is flexible, allowing you to create custom triggers and medications, as well as enter notes about each headache.  iHeadache is the perfect tool for gathering everything you need to know in one convenient place.  You can even generate reports to share with your physician.  Break down the information into 7, 28 or 30 days, or by specific months to show:\n\n• The types of headaches you have\n• The number of headaches during a specified period of time\n• Medications and dosages\n• The length of time you are completely and partially disabled  \n• Your MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment Scale) score\n• The sum of your headache triggers\n• Notes\n\nThe information and analysis units in iHeadache have been designed to help you and your doctor design an informed, optimized treatment plan. The report is specifically formatted so your physician can quickly analyze the data about your headaches. You can even choose to export your diary to a CSV file that can be opened in Excel, Numbers or other spreadsheet applications.\n\nVisit www.iHeadache.com to view the user manual, video tutorials, and quick start guide. \n\nIf you’d like to learn more about headaches or Dr. Loftus, please visit www.BellaireNeurology.com.\n\nWhy on earth would you want to suffer more or longer than you have to?

Unfortunately, only a small portion of those individuals seek treatment. This may be due, in large part, to cost of treatment and embarrassment. Thus, we have created a free-to-use mobile application for individual treatment using CBT.\n\nThe CBT mental health mobile application is a free-to-use app which (i) adds medication reminders, (ii) creates coping mechanisms which are both individualised to the user and fear specific, (iii) helps break down fears into smaller more manageable steps which can be tracked both on the calendar and using the activity history page, and (iv) has a thought journal to track and combat unhealthy thought patterns.\n\nCognitive Behavioural therapy, an evidence based treatment, focuses on thoughts and behaviours which make up the basis of anxiety. The idea is that thoughts about a situation affect how we feel, both emotionally and physically, and how we behave. Therefore, CBT teaches new ways or modified ways of thinking and behaving about a situation.\n\nAccording to Anxiety BC, CBT is one of the most effective treatments for anxiety and other illnesses such as depression, chronic pain, eating disorders, anger issues, addiction and low self-esteem.","2020-11-03","2022-08-08","6","0","0","0","0","6","6","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline, Accessibility, Own Your Own Data","Track Mood, Track Medication, Track Symptoms, Deep Breathing, Psychoeducation","Surveys, Diary","Notifications, References/Information, Reminders, Summary of Data, Graphs of Data","Mood Disorders, Stress & Anxiety","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Assessments/Screenings, Audio/Music/Scripts","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mentalhealthapp.mhamzasani.com.mentalhealthapp","","avaidyam@bidmc.harvard.edu","sagrario.m.d@hotmail.com","1604412046736","1659917056578"

In your pocket. iCouch CBT.\n\niCouch CBT puts the power of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in your pocket! iCouch CBT makes it easy to keep track of your thinking, analyze your emotions and change your outlook.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy is a type of therapy that helps you solve problems by focusing on changing your thoughts when faced with difficult situations. It's a goal-oriented approach that \trains\ you to rethink your reactions. You can't change your past, but you can change how you react to now.\n\nThe idea behind CBT is by changing your automatic thoughts to a situation, you can change how you feel. Automatic thoughts are often distorted. For example, you might see everything in black and white or maybe you see only the downsides to a situation. These distortions are what make you feel bad about something. iCouch CBT helps you recognize your thinking patterns and, as they say, knowing is half the battle! With increased awareness, you can begin the process of changing how you react -- eventually minimizing or eliminating the influence of thought-distortions.\n\nIf you suffer from stress, anger, anxiety, depression or bipolar disorders, CBT is a proven tool that can help you feel better, be more productive and improve your outlook. Everyone can benefit from iCouch CBT.\n\niCouch CBT features a clear, step-by-step approach that leads you through the CBT process. Unlike other CBT tools, iCouch CBT allows you to customize how you use the app. You can add your own emotions or distortions, delete the built-in ones and use the text fields however works best for you. It's your app for your life.\n\nYou start by filling out the \What Happened\ screen. Here you'll describe an upsetting situation. Next you describe your negative thoughts from the situation. You then will add your emotions, rating their intensity. Next, \Think About It\ and describe what you're thinking. Once you've described your thinking you'll have the chance to evaluate it and select the distortions that may be negatively influencing your feelings. Now, the best part.. After selecting the distortions that are making you feel bad, you'll then have the chance to create a better thought -- one that isn't distorted. You'll then write what you could do next time instead. Finally, you'll Re:Think and come up with your new thought and then you can reevaluate your emotions. At this point, you've had the chance to think it through completely and, almost by magic, you'll be feeling better!\n\nYou can then save the situation to \My Log,\ email it to yourself, a friend or your therapist. You can also view your situations on any of your iCloud-connected devices. This is an OPTIONAL feature, that you easily disable within the Settings section. iCouch (or Apple) can never see your answers. Your privacy is vitally important!\n\niCouch CBT features:\n\n* Optional password protection with Touch ID that protects your log and answers.\n* Optional iCloud integration\n* Optimized for both iPad and iPhone, retina and non retina screens.\n* A clear, step-by-step process.\n* Help screens for each step.\n* Emailing of your situations\n* Customizable emotions and distortions\n\niCouch CBT never collects any personal information. That includes location information, identifying information, usage or anything else. We take your privacy seriously. This app does not require a network connection, nor does it make network requests.\n\nWith iCouch CBT, you have the power of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in your pocket!","2020-04-21","2022-07-03","7","0","0","0","0","7","7","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Web","Payment, Free to Download","Spanish","Coach/Therapist Connection","Camera, Microphone","Link to Formal Care/Coaching","Mood Disorders, Stress & Anxiety, Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Can Delete Data, Meets HIPAA, Is PHI Shared, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared","Self Help, Hybrid","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Network Support, Collaborative With Provider/Other, User Generated Data, Videos","","","","icouch.me","abinaya.ramakrishnan@vanderbilt.edu","thompson.ken@northeastern.edu","1587482334975","1656832859803"

This may be because the causes of the illness are not fully understood. You may find that you need to continue treatment to keep well.\n\nUp to 3 in 10 people with schizophrenia may have a lasting recovery, and 1 in 5 people may show significant improvement. Around half of people diagnosed with schizophrenia will continue to have it as a long-term illness. Everyone’s experience of schizophrenia is different. It may get better then worse, involve further episodes of being unwell, or may be more constant.\n\nYou need to find the right treatment for you. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that you should be offered a combination of medication and talking therapies. \n\nGetting a diagnosis of schizophrenia can be devastating. You may be struggling to think clearly, manage your emotions, relate to other people, or even function normally. But having schizophrenia doesn’t mean you can’t live a full and meaningful life. Recovery is possible. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and improve your outlook, so if you suspect schizophrenia, see a doctor right away. With proper treatment, self-help, and support, many people are able to manage their symptoms, live and work independently, build satisfying relationships, and enjoy a rewarding life.\n\nDespite the widespread misconception that people with schizophrenia have no chance of recovery or improvement, the reality is much more hopeful. Although currently there is no cure for schizophrenia, you can treat and manage it with medication, self-help strategies, and supportive therapies. Since schizophrenia is often episodic, periods of remission from the severest symptoms often provide a good opportunity to start employing self-help strategies that may help to limit the length and frequency of future episodes.

Approximately one percent of the population develops schizophrenia during their lifetime - more than two million Americans suffer from the illness in any given year. Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties; women are generally affected in the twenties to early thirties. People with schizophrenia often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others, or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Their speech and behaviour can be disorganised and strange to the extent that they may be incomprehensible or frightening to others.\n\nHow is Schizophrenia Diagnosed?\n\nThere is currently no physical or lab test that can conclusively diagnose schizophrenia - a psychiatrist usually makes the diagnosis based on clinical symptoms. Physical testing can rule out many other conditions (seizure disorders, metabolic disorders, thyroid dysfunction, brain tumour, the effects of street drug use, and so on) that sometimes have similar symptoms.\n\nWhat causes Schizophrenia?\n\nAlthough the exact cause of schizophrenia remains unknown, experts agree that schizophrenia develops as a result of interplay between biological predisposition (for example, inheriting certain genes) and environmental factors. These lines of research are beginning to converge: brain development disruption is likely the result of genetic and/or environmental stressors early in development (during pregnancy or early childhood), leading to subtle alterations in the brain. Environmental factors later in development can either damage the brain further and further increase the risk of schizophrenia, or lessen the expression of genetic or neurodevelopment defects, thus decreasing the risk of schizophrenia.\n\nTreatment for schizophrenia\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association publication 'Guidelines for the Treatment of Patients with Schizophrenia' states: \Antipsychotic medications are indicated for nearly all acute psychotic episodes in patients with schizophrenia.\\n\nThere is also a significant overlap in terms of the medications for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Manic Depression).\nThere are two main classifications of medications (from a layman's perspective); the traditional antipsychotic medications (Haldol, etc.), and the newer, 'atypical' antipsychotic medications that have come out in the past decade (Clozapine, Geodon, Seroquel, Risperdal, Zyprexa, Abilify, etc.). It is recommended that sufferers or their carers speak to online support groups to get in touch with others, and to hear about their personal successes and problems with the different medications. It is also a good idea to read as much as possible regarding the medications available, and talk with a psychiatrist, to identify the medications that may be appropriate. It should be kept in mind that whilst both the older and newer medications can greatly help a person with schizophrenia, they all have significant side effects that vary according to the individual. No medication available, unfortunately, constitutes an actual cure for schizophrenia.\n\nA natural treatment for schizophrenia?\n\nWhile the conclusions drawn range from the positive to the negative, research does suggest that people with schizophrenia may benefit by a reduction in symptoms when they take fish oil capsules that are high in the EPA (a type of Omega-3 fatty acid) form of oil. It is important to be careful about the type of fish oil you are using, as not all fish oils are effective.\n\nDownload the app to know more..","2022-06-27","2022-06-27","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline, Accessibility","Psychoeducation","","References/Information","Schizophrenia","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ChandSekh.RemdFrSchizop&hl=en_US&gl=US","","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","1656361588906","1656361588906"

Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time. \nThe causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors. Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, certain infections, parental age and poor nutrition during pregnancy. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior, the person's reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person. During diagnosis a person's culture must also be taken into account. As of 2013 there is no objective test. Schizophrenia does not imply a \split personality\ or dissociative identity disorder – conditions with which it is often confused in public perception. \n==========================\nAPP FEATURES\n==========================\nThis exclusive app will help to understand the Schizophrenia Guide, Schizophrenia Disease Management & Schizophrenia Disease causes.\nHere are features that make this app better than all other Schizophrenia Disease apps - \n-\tUI of app is very user responsive and easy to navigate. \n-\tEasily Change the page.\n-\tData of app is collected from various research reports.\n-\tYou can access these favorites whenever you want.\n-\tShare your favorite benefits with your friends and family through email, SMS, Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\n\nAll these features are available for free. \n\n==========================\nSAY HELLO\n==========================\nAny medical information published on this app is not intended as a substitute for informed medical advice and you should not take any action before consulting with a healthcare professional.

Personal therapy, as it is called, aims to create a therapeutic umbrella to protect the patients from undue personal stress. Recent studies have suggested that over the long haul, individual psychotherapy tailored to strengthen interpersonal skills and control social stress markedly helps many people suffering from the disorder.\n\nThis new form of schizophrenia treatment has resulted in lower relapse rates and progressively better social functioning over 3 years, at least for people able to live with family members and meet basic survival needs, contend social worker Gerard E. Hogarty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and his colleagues.\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been judged by the Cochrane review as potentially positive for people with schizophrenia, stating that evidence suggests \ that it [CBT] may well be of value, at least in the short term. Cognitive behavioural therapy should be further evaluated in various clinical settings and comparing effects for both expert and less skilled practitioners.\\n\nFamily therapy and assertive community treatment have clear effects on the prevention of psychotic relapse and rehospitalization. However, these treatments have no consistent effects on other outcome measures (e.g., pervasive positive and negative symptoms, overall social functioning, and ability to obtain competitive employment). Social skills training improves social skills but has no clear effects on relapse prevention, psychopathology, or employment status. Supportive employment programs that use the place-and-train vocational model have important effects on obtaining competitive employment. Some studies have shown improvements in delusions and hallucinations following cognitive behavior therapy. Preliminary research indicates that personal therapy may improve social functioning.\n\nResearch suggests that relatively simple, long-term psychoeducational family therapy should be available to the majority of persons suffering from schizophrenia. Assertive community training programs ought to be offered to patients with frequent relapses and hospitalizations, especially if they have limited family support. Patients with schizophrenia can clearly improve their social competence with social skills training, which may translate into a more adaptive functioning in the community. For patients interested in working, rapid placement with ongoing support offers the best opportunity for maintaining a regular job in the community. Cognitive behavior therapy may benefit the large number of patients who continue to experience disabling psychotic symptoms despite optimal pharmacological treatment.","2022-06-27","2022-06-27","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline, Accessibility","Psychoeducation","","References/Information","Schizophrenia","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Can Delete Data, App Reports Security Measures in Place, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is PHI Shared","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memi.HoRemedieFSchizoph&hl=en_US&gl=US","","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","1656362279504","1656362279504"

These badges will motivate people to quit their addiction.\n\n• Do you want to STAY SOBER for a longer time?\n• Do you want to quit the addiction which is affecting your life?\n• Are you tired of constant relapses and struggle to maintain a good streak?\n• Are you someone who is looking for improvement in every aspect of life?\n\nIf yes, then NO ALCOHOL is for you.\n\n\nNo Alcohol - Quit Drinking App Features:\n\n* Sober day tracker: Visualize how long you’ve been sober and monitor your sobriety journey over time. Track the time you spend without drinking, smoking, etc. Count your sober days.\n\n* History Note: You can add a history note to record your number of urges for a drink and your mood during the day, and a short description/note about the whole day.\n\n* Drinking reasons: You can add reasons for drinking alcohol. So, whenever you have the urge to drink alcohol, read these reasons and feel strongly about not doing the same mistakes.\n\n* Trophies / Badges: You can achieve badges on Sober time, money save, life regained and a number of drinks did not drink.\n\nI hope my No Alcohol - Quit Drinking app helps you break this habit and stop drinking for good to become a sober healthy person forever :)\n\n\n\nHow to use it?\n\nThis app counts the days you have passed without drinking.

Working the Big Book through this app will allow you to work the steps while your addicted loved one works through Alcoholics Anonymous or another recovery program. \n\nAL-ATEEN: It is very confusing for teenagers who have addicts in their life. They may get false information about drugs and alcohol. They might feel pressured into using themselves. Teenagers with family member addicts or other addicts in their life have a much higher risk of developing an addiction. It is important they get the chance to be a part of Al-Ateen and learn the Al-Ateen literature as well.\n\nFEATURES:\n+ 1000+ audio tracks, 100+ hours of content\n+ Listen when offline\n+ Build a playlist of the tracks you want to hear\n+ Sleep and meditation timer\n+ Looping relaxation and meditation sounds (over 2.4 million combinations)\n+ Daily inspiration notifications with powerful artwork to keep you motivated\n\nCONTENT INCLUDED:\nHere are samples of the audio content you will discover throughout this app:\n\n+ Al-Anon Personal Audio Stories from The Forum Magazine\n+ Al-Anon Speaker Tapes\n+ Having Relationships in AA & Al-Anon Workshop by Keith and Sue D.\n+ History of Al-Anon and Steps by Vannoy S.\n+ Living With Crazy People Workshop by Tom W.\n+ Making Choices in Recovery by Larcine G.\n+ Practicing Traditions in All Our Relationships by Ellen C.\n+ Understanding the 12 Steps, Sponsorship and Spirituality by Blanche M.\n+ Bill Wilson Stories from Alcoholics Anonymous\n+ Guided Meditations for Mindfulness, Relaxation & Sleep\n+ Inspiring Personal Stories of Sobriety & Recovery\n+ The Complete AA Big Book Audio and Text for Alcoholics Anonymous\n--------\n\nDetails about auto-renewing subscriptions:\n\n* 1 Month (auto renews every month) for $3.99\n* 3 Month (auto renews every 3 months) for $6.99\n* Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n* Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n* No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period\n* Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication. \n\nPlease read our privacy policy and terms of use: http://audiojoy.com/terms","2022-06-07","2022-06-07","3","0","0","0","1","2","3","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","iOS","Free to Download, Payment, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Accessibility","Picture Gallery/Hope Board","Microphone","Notifications, References/Information, Social Network","Substance Use (Alcohol), Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared","Reference","Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Well Written Relevant Content","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/alanon-workshops-aa-12-steps/id1090761219","","","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","1654627873880","1654627873880"

The program itself has been used with great success for over 20 years, and is now finally available in a mobile format. You can make it work for you.\r\n\r\nWith Saying When, you can get help and keep your concerns about your drinking private. There’s no need to attend meetings or open up in front of a group. It’s a self-help approach that truly is anonymous and can positively influence your health, your job, or your relationships.\r\n\r\nA PROGRAM THAT WORKS\r\nBased on research and evaluation of various treatment methods for patients with alcohol problems Saying When is a self-help program that has a proven track record. The same tools that successful people have consistently used to bring their drinking under control for over 20 years are used in this mobile version. \r\n\r\nSELF-ASSESSMENT\r\nAnswer a few quick questions to set your baseline for success.

(It is not a simple smoking management App.)\r\n\r\nNeverSmoking enables you to quit smoking permanently by removing the fundamental smoking-neuron which is an emotional information attracting thoughts of cigarette. \r\n\r\nNeverSmoking enables a powerful quitting smoking effect through activation of the mirror neurons through the innate facial recognition system of the brain, emotional priming through facial feedback and thoracic respiration. It is a safe yet a powerful therapy to quit smoking.\r\n\r\nNeverSmoking removes the false reward system created by nicotine in the smoker’s brain and replaces it with a new synaptic connection\r\n\r\nNeverSmoking enables the smoker to gain an accurate understanding of one’s addiction so that they can intelligently and systematically manage the smoking desires in order to make thoughts of tobacco to never recur and quit smoking permanently in a short period of time(usually within a month).\r\n\r\nNeverSmoking is composed of 200 expressions and 21 topics and it runs based on automatic analysis of the smoker’s dispositions, patterns and terms of smoking and their sensorial characteristics.\r\n\r\nIt is designed so that the user can quit smoking by merely mimicking the contents on the screen.\r\n\r\nNeverSmoking app is based on years of data and expert know-hows on smoking cessation.\r\n\r\nWith NeverSmoking, you will be able to quit smoking for good in the most healthy and fundamental way and you will never crave smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n* How to Use the Program\r\n1. Follow and copy the facial expressions in each stage and make sure you concentrate on the images and the messages provided.\r\n2. NeverSmoking relies on the natural and instinctual function of the human brain, which is facial expression recognition, to activates the mirror neurons. Thus, we encourage you to play the program in a place where there is minimum distraction to the visual images and where it is not too loud.

That requires willpower – and honest and unadulterated statistics.\n\nOur application provides you with an objective and detailed view of your cigarette consumption.  How many cigarettes do you really smoke – and how much does it really cost?   Analyze it now: with help from your individual statistics.   Simply enter the price of the pack and each cigarette smoked into the application program.  From this data, the software calculates an overview of your daily consumption, as well as the costs which accompany it.  In order to maintain error-free statistics, cigarettes which are accidentally added into the program can be deleted within 30 seconds.  \n\nFurthermore, you’ll receive information about your minimal, maximal, and average cigarette consumption over a specified time period, the total amount of smoked cigarettes as well as the full costs arising from your cigarette consumption. \n\nAll data collected is displayed in clearly arranged diagrams.  With the well-known “swipe” technique from the weather application, you can easily and comfortably page through the individual diagrams of daily statistics.  \n\nThis free demo version of “Stop Smoking” provides you with the same comfortable functions as the full version; however, only the statistics of the last 8 days are displayed.  After testing the software and its simple and intuitive operation, upgrading to the full version of “Stop Smoking” provides you with a complete and reliable overview of  your cigarette consumption.  \n\n=== Customer review's ===\nWow 1st: ***** (Five stars)\n\nI tried the lite version and was impresed by the graphing of the app. I looked through other apps and this is the only one I could find that offered good quality graphing.

For some, it begins early, for others it starts as we age. We can all sense when our back is about to give out. immobility and helplessness.\r\n\r\nThere are many causes of back pain including strain while lifting, exercise, or chronic overuse of the muscles. Fortunately, there are many ways to release the tension in your lower back including yoga poses. \r\n\r\nYoga poses can be done anywhere and don’t require equipment, so they provide an easy fix for tension. The moves work by both releasing knots and stretching out muscle fibers via relaxing and restorative postures.\r\n\r\nSome immediate relief can be found through doctors, chiropractors and massage therapists. Sometimes surgery and drugs seem like the only long-term solution. \r\n\r\nFor a growing number of people though, life style changes, often through physical therapy and yoga, are the long-term answer. I argue from personal experience that developing a regular yoga practice will offer the same benefits of physical therapy with many added bonuses overall for the lower back pain sufferer. And its not just me saying so, either. In a report about a case study (Medscape Medical News 09/29/16), a regular yoga practice was shown to be as effective in relieving pain for the lower back pain sufferer as physical therapy. \r\n\r\nNow, this is hardly definitive proof that all lower back pain sufferers will benefit from yoga or that all yoga is good for back pain. However, a growing number of us are finding solutions in our yoga practice. The additional benefits of practicing yoga regularly are vast, and pretty exciting. The biggest for me was development of mindfulness. It is amazing how a simple shift in focus to the breath immediately brings you into the present moment. Not a bad bonus at all. Just like any physical activity, remember to consult with your physician or physical therapist before beginning the physical aspect of the yoga practice.\r\n\r\nApp features include:\r\n- Stunning design with easy to follow yoga poses and timers\r\n- Clear instructions, mindfulness practice, benefits and contraindications for each yoga poses to guide you \r\n- All content is INCLUDED (no additional charges, and no need for internet connectivity) \r\n- Reminder notifications that can be adjusted to fit your busy lifestyle \r\n- Included Back pain guide to understanding your condition and knowing your treatment options.\r\n- Included 11 easy Yoga Poses to relieve lower back pain and tension in 10 minutes or less:\r\n1. Child's Pose | Balasana\r\n2. Extended Puppy Pose | Uttana Shishosana\r\n3. Cobra Pose | Bhujangasana\r\n4. Cat Pose | Marjaryasana - Cow Pose | Bitilasana\r\n5. Pigeon Pose | Eka Pada Rajakapotasana\r\n6. Half Lord Of The Fishes Pose | Ardha Matsyendrasana\r\n7. Wind Release Pose | Pawanmuktasana\r\n8. Knees To Chest Pose | Apanasana\r\n9.

There are between 2-3 new cases of psychosis per 1000 population in any year. Research evidence demonstrates that early intervention in first episode psychosis improves outcomes. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the nature of the illness and navigating mental health services can be a challenging experience, for patients and their carers. Healthcare professionals in primary care and non-mental health clinicians commonly have limited experience in its management. \r\n\r\nThe information in the PIER app will be useful for anyone interested in knowing more about psychosis and its current gold standard management. It will empower patients and the public with good quality evidence based information from reliable sources and from people in the front line of clinical care. Healthcare professionals will benefit by getting useful information at their fingertips. It can be helpful in setting up similar services and first episode psychosis care pathways, anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThe PIER app provides a single platform for patients and carers to learn more about the symptoms of psychosis and its management, particularly what to expect when under the PIER Team. There are helpful links which provide information about psychosis and related disorders. There are useful links to improve knowledge of therapeutic interventions, including medication used to treat psychosis and other psychosocial interventions, like cognitive behavioural therapy and family therapy. The app has information about the referral process, recovery and how to seek help in crises. There is focus on healthy lifestyle choices and physical health monitoring in severe mental illness. \r\n\r\nFor healthcare professionals, the app provides useful information about referral criteria to secondary care, what to look for in suspected psychosis and useful information on management, including the Care Planning Process. There are links providing information on Waiting Times and Access Standards, as set by the Department of Health in NHS England as well as NICE standards for the assessment and management of psychosis and schizophrenia. \r\n\r\nThere are helpful videos about the roles and responsibilities of different professionals in the service and physical health monitoring of patients in the service. This can also be accessed as readable information. \r\n\r\nThis is the first phase in the development of the app.","2020-04-09","2021-09-30","9","0","0","0","2","7","9","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","PARTIAL: Happier meditation (a298f22c6673441cb075297d19fda38a)","Android, Web, iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Psychoeducation","","References/Information","Non-Specific, Schizophrenia","","Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","Government, Healthcare Company","Videos","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pier/id1313722873?ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.commontime.infinity.PIER_POC&hl=en_US","https://www.leics-his.nhs.uk/pier-app/","sarah.lagan5@gmail.com","sestoeckl@wustl.edu","1586471223432","1633009745092"

The way we think about ourselves, other people and our place in the world has a direct influence on our emotional state and our behavior. Consequently by changing the way we think we can positively influence our mood and how we respond to situations.  This is the premise behind Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) which has become the most effective psychological treatment available for a range of emotional and behavioral problems including depression and anxiety. \n\nMonitoring or tracking a person’s mood can be an important part of CBT and other psychological and psychiatric treatments. The Mood & Anxiety Diary is a useful way to track changes in mood and anxiety over time. It allows the user and / or therapist to see if there are any patterns in a person’s mood variations and levels of anxiety. The Mood & Anxiety Diary involves people recording their mood and levels of anxiety at regular intervals to help them to recognize the factors which may be impacting on their emotional state. These patterns or events that trigger changes in mood and anxiety can be explored and the appropriate treatments applied- cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and / or medication. In addition, the Mood & Anxiety Diary can track whether the treatment has been effective in helping stabilize and lift a person’s mood. \n\nLow mood and anxiety are closely linked and often a person with low mood will experience increased anxiety, and a person with an anxiety problem may suffer from low mood. This is why we have designed the Mood & Anxiety Diary to track mood and anxiety together which will help users and professionals to see if there is an interaction between them. However, the application also allows the user to track either mood or anxiety individually which may be helpful if an individual is suffering from a mood disorder without features of anxiety, or an anxiety disorder without low mood.  \n\nTo increase flexibility for users, the Mood & Anxiety Diary is designed to allow individuals to enter mood or anxiety ratings at any time.  The range for mood and anxiety is 1 -  10, with 1 being the lowest rating (very low mood / low levels of anxiety) and 10 being the highest rating (elevated mood / high levels of anxiety). It is recommended that a person using the Mood & Anxiety Diary should enter regular ratings of their mood and anxiety of at least one value per day. If the user experiences fluctuations in mood or anxiety during a day, it may be helpful to enter data more regularly e.g. in the morning, afternoon and evenings. There is a handy feature which allows users to enter in notes along side the rating. For example; to record if there is an event or obvious reason for a change in mood or anxiety. The Mood & Anxiety Diary will display data in a graph which makes it much easier to view and analyze.\n\nSimilar to our other CBT applications, the Mood & Anxiety Diary was designed by an experienced clinical psychologist and CBT therapist who believed that these tools should be available in the most accessible form for individuals to use in today’s fast technological world. The Mood & Anxiety Diary can be used by people either in therapy or taking a course of medication as a useful adjunct to the treatment, and there is a feature that allows the Mood & Anxiety Diary to be emailed straight to a therapist or doctor. However, the Mood & Anxiety Diary can also be used by those individuals who are embarking on a self-guided course of CBT.","2020-04-21","2021-09-15","5","0","0","0","5","0","5","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","iOS","Payment","Offline, Email or Export Your Data, Accessibility","Track Mood, Track Symptoms, Journaling","Surveys, Diary","Graphs of Data, Summary of Data","Mood Disorders, Stress & Anxiety","","Self Help, Hybrid","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mood-anxiety-diary/id393280344","","","abinaya.ramakrishnan@vanderbilt.edu","ecamach1@bidmc.harvard.edu","1587490994206","1631734304443"

I started mindfulness a few months ago after my new therapist recommended it & found the breathing exercises helpful but really easy to forget or ignore. \n\nThis app has reminders, guides you through the meditation techniques & the best part is the pause button. When I start feeling tense I just take a little pause and get my breathing under control. Having the images to view while breathing activates more of my mind freeing the anxious thoughts. The reminders can be set for whenever or how often I may need them which helps me return to the moment when I don't even realize I'm tense. \n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from anxiety or just wants to live a more mindful, present life.\\n- PookusJ (iTunes review)\n\nFeatured:\n\n- Featured in the iTunes App Store “What’s Hot” list in over 20 countries\n- Developed with leading scientists, doctors, researchers, coaches and trainers\n- Recommended by the Daily Mail as a “Stress-Busting Smartphone App to Keep You Calm on the Go”\n- Powered by inward inc., which has been mentioned in The NYTimes, Newsweek, and NPR\n\n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Integration with Apple's Health app to track Mindful Minutes\n- Simple Start program: 21 days of free mindfulness audio lessons.

It will recondition all your thoughts you currently have about smoking.\r\n\r\nThe audio program starts off with a brief relaxation process with the sound of crashing waves in the background. After the relaxation period, you will hear the re-programming statements or affirmations, each one purposefully repeated three times. The affirmations are stated in the first person, present tense.\r\n\r\nFind a place where you can relax undisturbed and with no interruptions for approximately 20 minutes. Sit or lie down in a comfortable position, loosen any tight clothing. Put your ear/headphones on and press the play button.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the session. At the end of the 20 minutes, the sound of the crashing waves simply fades, giving you the choice to either continue relaxing or going to sleep, or waking up.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you listen to this audio upon awakening, at bedtime and sometime during the day for at least 30 days.\r\n\r\nPlease eliminate the usage of the following words for the next six months: cigarette, smoke, smoking, matches or any other words that relate or remind you of smoking. The words just mentioned contain the thought of smoking, which is what you will want to eliminate from your thinking.\r\n\r\nAll meaningful change in life begins from within.\r\n\r\n*** Please Note: This session was created by my colleague Hani Al-Qasem.

The elevated mood is significant and is known as mania or hypomania, depending on its severity, or whether symptoms of psychosis are present. During mania, an individual behaves or feels abnormally energetic, happy, or irritable. Individuals often make poorly thought out decisions with little regard to the consequences. The need for sleep is usually reduced during manic phases. During periods of depression, there may be crying, a negative outlook on life, and poor eye contact with others. The risk of suicide among those with the illness is high at greater than 6 percent over 20 years, while self-harm occurs in 30–40 percent.

We want you to stop smoking, “Quit Smoking App” is an idea coming from someone who used to be a smoker and successfully let this bad habit go. While going through this tough process, a lot of challenges were faced. We want to make the process of making your life smoke free easy and manageable on your fingertips through this simple app.\r\n\r\n“Quit Smoking App” starts off by taking a note of the number of cigarettes you consume each day. It also asks you to provide your average sleeping time per day. Based on this provided information, it calculates the number of cigarettes you smoke in the time you’re awake. This information allows “Quit Smoking App” to provide you with equal interval countdowns between each time you smoke. As we know scientifically that you cannot quit your nicotine urge all of a sudden in a single day. Therefore “Quit Smoking App” has a mechanism to increase the countdown time so that you learn to control your urge. This learning process increases your ability to overcome yourself and limit your dependence on nicotine. Day by day this limit is increased and if you follow the process of “Quit Smoking App”, you’ll rewarded with badges and awards. You can share these awards and badges with your loved one’s on social media and make the process even more interesting with the encouragement of the people following you. Similarly, if you fail to follow the countdown, and end up smoking before the interval time is over, you’re given a penalty. Don’t worry as this penalty is not a big one, it is just a challenge that you’ve to complete and stay a strong believer that you’ll quit smoking. Until one day, “Quit Smoking App” will calculate that you’re smoke free for a specific span of time. This would be the day that you’ve achieved your objective and the goal of our efforts. \r\n\r\nFeatures of “Quit Smoking App”\r\nCalculate Your Smoke Free Time \r\n“Quit Smoking App” allows you to calculate the time since your last smoke. The entire concept of this quit trackerapp is to increase your smoke-free time using a gamification approach to make the process easier, interesting and memorable for you. \r\nBeing in Coordination with other participants\r\n“Quit Smoking App” gives its users an opportunity to send requests to other people in their contact list. Once added, a user can not only chat with other users, but they can also compete \r\nwith each other. Hence, we don’t only encourage users to quit smoking, but we also promote socializing through our chat option.  \r\nTrack Money That You Saved\r\n“Quit Smoking App” will keep a track of money that you saved while staying smoke free. It will calculate the number of cigarettes that you didn’t smoke and hence ended up saving a handsome amount of money. Apart from this, it also calculates the amount that you spend each day on smoking. \r\nAward & Penalty System\r\n“Quit Smoking App” will give you rewards if you meet the smoke interval targets. These rewards can be shared on social media. Apart from this, the app is designed to throw a penalty as a challenge your way if you do not meet the smoke free interval target. These penalties are healthy snacks or activities that would benefit your health along with keeping you busy and interested in the whole process to quit smoking.","2021-07-29","2021-07-29","1","0","0","0","1","0","1","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Accessibility","Physical Health, Goal Setting/Habits","","Notifications, References/Information","Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Device, Is PHI Shared, App Reports Security Measures in Place, App Declares Data Use and Purpose","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges)","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cigar.quitsmoking","","klara.aastroem@yale.edu","klara.aastroem@yale.edu","1627525437401","1627525437401"

If you decide to stop cold turkey you have the option to skip the reducing program.\r\n\r\nThis app will support you with all kinds of extra stimulants by setting goals (for instance financially) which you can use as an incentive and reward yourself.\r\nThis app will also show statistics and graphs which will make you aware of your smoking out of habit rather then dependence.\r\n\r\nYou will see badges when you have reached your set goals and even health stats when stopped smoking completely.\r\n\r\nYou have the option to stop smoking together with your partner or friend(s) and compare your results by sharing your stats and graphs to motivate each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does reducing work?\r\nThe app will need 3 full days of input of your smoking behaviour to be able to calculate your personal reduce program. So these first 3 you just click the 'smoke a cigarette' button when you light a cigarette.\r\n\r\nThe fourth day you will have a set delay time between your cigarettes. For example 20 minutes. Within these 20 minutes you will see a red screen, with a timer. To fully benefit your reduce program you have to wait for the timer before you smoke your next cigarette. However if the you really need a cigarette and you can not wait for these few minutes to pass you will be able to smoke a 'penalty' cigarette.

Sick of all the expensive products and coaching that were supposed to help you quit this addictive smoking habit?\n\nStart using the “StopSmoking” app now to help you quit your smoking habit. StopSmoking is a mobile runner game which helps you to quit smoking in a fun and interactive way. By playing the game for just a few minutes a day, you will get more control over your desire to smoke a cigarette. As you keep playing this game, you will eventually be able to quit smoking forever.\n\nThe StopSmoking app is based on Cognitive Biased Modification; a computer-based therapy that works by gradually changing your attentional bias. The simple process of consciously and repeatedly selecting positive objects such as fruits over negative objects related to smoking, helps you to gradually develop a positive bias – a tendency to focus more on the positive information around you in everyday life. This positive bias effect that you learn from the StopSmoking app will support you to overcome your smoking addiction!\n\n\n**********************\nAPP FEATURES\n**********************\nStill wondering how this game makes quitting smoking easy? Here are the features of the app/game that make it unique -\n\n-\tBased on proven therapy CBM to overcome addictions\n-\tCollect healthy objects and dodge objects related to smoking\n-\tGame is over when you do not dodge smoking related objects\n-\tTips for cravings during the game\n-\tKeep track of your improvements\n-\tKeep track of high scores\n\n\nExcited to get started?

The therapy CBM has shown very positive effects during research for the major part of the test group. However, since it is a behavioural therapy, a lot of the treatment has to do with personal drive and a serious approach during practicing.","2021-07-21","2021-07-21","1","0","0","0","1","0","1","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Psychoeducation, Track Symptoms","Surveys","References/Information, Social Network","Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges)","","https://apps.apple.com/in/app/stopsmoking-quit-cigarette-smoking-habits/id1164073063","","","miltontnguyen@gmail.com","miltontnguyen@gmail.com","1626904835811","1626904835811"

It appears that, either through the stronger willpower or the gradual decrease, it is possible to reduce smoking without weight gain.\n\n2 simple steps: \n- assess your habit (either over 24 h or if you know your smoking pattern - input it in 1 minute)\n- practice and get feedback every 24h\n\nBy the time we ask you for money, you are likely to have saved it - this app pays for itself. \n\nThe first module will initially remove 1 to 2 cigarettes of your habit and in the practice bit keeps informing you when you can smoke without missing your target. If you have iOS10 or later, it will send you convenient (silent) reminders, saving you from having to go into the app.\nAfter every 24 h you can choose to remove another one of your habit cigarettes, although we recommend to keep a target for 5-7 days before you reduce further.\n\nYour 24h feedback includes how well you have done, how much you have saved and how much you could save if you keep going for a year. This version works with the average brand cigarette price of £0.5 in the U.K. Once you are asked to buy the module, you are likely to have saved the money already - or will have saved it in a few days. From then onwards, saved money - is your money - and for happy times. \n\nLet's get our control back, and at the same time get stronger, healthier and save money.\n\nBecause we care:\nPlease be conscious that every bad habit, even if reduced, constitutes a health risk, and smoking is a serious one.

Having trouble sleeping or managing your emotions? Can't stop negative thoughts?

And the act of thinking in this way can be therapeutic—it helps you solve your own problems.\ \r\n\r\n- Quartz\r\n\r\n\In creating their own personal chatbots, many Replika users have discovered something like friendship: a digital companion with whom to celebrate victories, lament failures, and trade weird internet memes.\\r\n\r\n- Wired\r\n\r\n\Replika’s growing popularity among young people in particular (its main users are aged between 18 and 25) represents a renaissance in chatbots. It also marks an intriguing use case for AI in all the worry about job destruction: a way to talk through emotional problems when other human beings aren’t available.\\r\n\r\n- Forbes\r\n\r\n\I'm not sure why but it took a while to work up the nerve to make the call. When I finally did, it was much more fun than I expected.

It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! \r\n\r\nPersonally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What’s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... \r\n\r\nIt also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you've abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.\r\n\r\nFEATURES: \r\n\r\n• Food Journal / Diary \r\n\r\nIn addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.\r\n\r\nYou could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.\r\nAs a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.\r\n\r\nThere are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.\r\n\r\nAlthough individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan — no matter how flexible or structured — is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA's Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.\r\nSource:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html\r\n\r\n\r\n• Gratitude List \r\nIf you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  \r\n\r\n* Hardship Discounts Available \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:\r\n1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.\r\n2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.\r\n\r\nSpiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.\r\n\r\n * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

The good news is there are several simple things you can do to ease the pain without a trip to the doctor or drugstore. Try these tips and get to feeling better fast.\r\n\r\n1. Try a Cold Pack\r\nIf you have a migraine, place a cold pack on your forehead. Ice cubes wrapped in a towel, a bag of frozen peas, or even a cold shower may lessen the pain. Keep the compress on your head for 15 minutes, then take a break for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Use a Heating Pad or Hot Compress\r\nIf you have a tension headache, place a heating pad on your neck or the back of your head. If you have a sinus headache, hold a warm cloth to the area that hurts. A warm shower might also do the trick.\r\n3. Ease Pressure on Your Scalp or Head\r\nIf your ponytail is too tight, it could cause a headache. These \external compression headaches\ can also be brought on by wearing a hat, headband, or even swimming goggles that are too tight. In one study, women who loosened their hair saw their headache disappear.\r\n\r\n4. Dim the Lights\r\nBright or flickering light, even from your computer screen, can cause migraine headaches. If you’re prone to them, cover your windows with blackout curtains during the day. Wear sunglasses outdoors. You might also add anti-glare screens to your computer and use daylight-spectrum fluorescent bulbs in your light fixtures.\r\n\r\n5. Try Not to Chew\r\nChewing gum can hurt not just your jaw, but your head as well. The same is true for chewing your fingernails, lips, the inside or your cheeks, or handy objects like pens. Avoid crunchy and sticky foods, and make sure you take small bites. If you grind your teeth at night, ask your dentist about a mouth guard. This may curb your early-morning headaches.\r\n\r\n6. Get Some Caffeine\r\nHave some tea, coffee, or something with a little caffeine in it. If you get it early enough, it could ease your headache pain. It can also help over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen, work better. Just don’t drink too much because caffeine withdrawal can cause its own type of headache.\r\n\r\nTOP PICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Practice Relaxation\r\nWhether it’s stretches, yoga, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation, learning how to chill out when you’re in the middle of a headache can help with the pain. You might even talk to your doctor about physical therapy if you have muscle spasms in your neck.\r\n\r\n8.Try Massage\r\nYou can do it yourself. A few minutes massaging your neck and temples can help ease a tension headache, which may result from stress.\r\n\r\n9. Take Some Ginger\r\nA small recent study found that taking ginger, in addition to regular, over-the-counter pain medicine, eased pain for people in the ER with migraines. Another found that it worked almost as well as prescription migraine medicine. You can try a supplement or maybe brew some tea.\r\n10. Take medicine in Moderation\r\nPharmacy shelves are stocked with pain relievers for all kinds of headaches. They may work, but to get the most benefit with the least risk, follow the directions on the label and these guidelines:\r\n\r\nChoose liquid over pills. Your body absorbs it faster.\r\nTake painkillers as soon as you feel pain. You’ll likely beat it with a smaller dose.\r\nIf you get sick to your stomach when you get a headache, ask your doctor what might help.\r\nAsk your doctor what to take to avoid a rebound headache -- pain that sets in after a few days of taking pain relievers.\r\nAnd be sure to talk to your doctor about what headache symptoms you should not try to treat at home.","2021-06-20","2021-06-22","2","0","0","0","1","1","2","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline, Accessibility","Psychoeducation","","Social Network","Headache","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared","Self Help","Patient Facing","For Profit Company","","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HowToCureHeadache.fj","","qhossai000@citymail.cuny.edu","ecamach1@bidmc.harvard.edu","1624154617137","1624369758382"

But are you concerned about the side effects of your medication? If so, you are not the only one! Many people are worried and are looking to explore complementary treatments, but do they work and should you be cautious? There are many different types of complementary therapies (CAM) out, and these should not be considered in isolation but as part of an overall approach to general well being (including improved control of headache and migraine). Traditionally, complementary and alternative medicine has been considered outside the realm of conventional medicine. Western medicine has focused on the acute treatment of disease and injury, whereas CAM typically promotes health and prevention of disease. Yet this distinction is changing. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to an array of healing practices and medicines that exist outside of conventional treatments. These practices are thought to provide a more natural and holistic approach to healing a variety of ailments. Many people across the globe find success in getting relief from their Migraine headaches with alternative techniques. Even with medical treatment you may still find yourself banging your head against the wall from persistent Migraine attacks.  Many Migraineurs find themselves turning to complementary or \alternative\ treatments out of frustration when they are having limited success with prescription drugs and other approved medical treatments.  This app will introduce you to some non-pharmaceutical therapies. These treatments offer many of us additional relief, but are NOT an excuse to abandoned approved medical care.  Rather they will offer you an opportunity to gain more control over you Migraine disease management.  They will work better if integrated into your overall care.

No matter how much weight is lost, the person continues to fear weight gain.\r\n\r\nAnorexia isn't really about food.

Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake dependence on binge eating and overeating.\r\n \r\n \r\nHere are our top 7 reasons to stop being addicted to food:\r\n \r\n1. You eat way more food than you intended to\r\n \r\nBeing addicted to food means that you will keep eating, even when your stomach says that you are full. This is why food addiction is not only physical, but it is psychological as well.\r\n \r\n2. You experience food cravings even after being full\r\n \r\nGetting food cravings is not uncommon. However, having a food addiction means that you experience those cravings even when your stomach is packed full of food. This can be mentally draining.\r\n \r\n3. Feelings of guilt and regret\r\n \r\nMany overeaters will experience guilt after eating large quantities of food, as most people do. The problem is that people addicted to food will quickly get over that feeling and do it over and over again.\r\n \r\n4. Excessive weight gain\r\n \r\nWhen you are addicted to food, you keep eating, even when your body tells you not to. This creates a surplus of calories in your body, which leads to weight gain, which is mostly fat.\r\n \r\n5. Do you make up excuses for eating too much?\r\n \r\n“I’ll only have a few” and “just for today” are things that we tell ourselves all the time when we know we shouldn’t be eating something. When we repeat these mistakes over and over, we just feed the food addiction, and things won’t get better until you take a stand.\r\n \r\n6. Imagine how much money you will save\r\n \r\nI like to use the example of a pizza. Someone addicted to food might eat the whole pizza in one sitting, but someone conscious of their food intake may eat half the pizza and save the other half. 2 meals for the price of one! Make it happen.\r\n \r\n7. You keep failing the rules that you set for yourself\r\n \r\nIf you are addicted to food, you will habitually break the rules that you set for yourself to cut back eating. It will be difficult at first with hunger cravings, but your stomach will eventually adapt to the decrease in consumption. Your health will thank you.\r\n \r\n....If you are guilty of being addicted to food or binge eating, download Food Addiction Calendar for FREE now!","2021-06-10","2021-06-11","2","0","0","0","1","1","2","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","PARTIAL: Food Addiction Calendar - Stop (314f3ea7c94f4c72842b5f6897c77f06)","iOS, Android","Free to Download, Payment, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Offline, Email or Export Your Data","Goal Setting/Habits, Peer Support, Productivity, Journaling","Camera, Surveys","Notifications, Reminders, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data","Eating Disorders","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place","Self Help","Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Well Written Relevant Content","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Chat/Message, Gamification (Points/Badges), Peer Support","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/food-addiction-calendar/id1112385170#?platform=iphone","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FoodAddiction.Calendar&hl=en_US&gl=US","","tolear01@tufts.edu","ecamach1@bidmc.harvard.edu","1623343691966","1623415953382"

Make this space your own by filling it with thoughts, ideas, worries, concerns, feelings, hopes and dreams. Use it knowing that anything you don’t want to keep inside your mind - HOLD will hold it for you.\r\n\r\nOften people cannot engage properly with things that are on their mind because it might be hard or confusing, it may take the time they don’t have or it may seem like a waste of time. Talking with yourself in HOLD helps you release your thoughts in a clear and productive way and without fear of judgment. You can always return to these conversations later with a fresh perspective so you can continue to progress even if you have little time in your life. \r\n\r\nHOLD guides you into learning self-reflection in an easy and accessible way, encouraging you to develop your personal practice of self-reflection and maintain useful and healthy thought processes.

Before I started, I was experiencing constant worry, pain, stress and even depression. Meditating for 20 minutes a day with minding radically changed the way my days and eventually my life felt. Monty, thank you for your help, your meditations really saved my life.”\r\n- Teresa Hergueta\r\n\r\n“I'm so happy to have found minding. The app has proved to be a friendly and useful guide and provided me with all the tools I need to develop my practice. Throughout the course, each meditation is delivered in a soothing, melodic tone which supports the development of the key principles of mindfulness; I recommend minding to people I work with who are looking to achieve the benefits of mindfulness. To date, those documented include improved sleep, increased ability to regulate emotions and enhanced wellbeing, I would highly recommend this app to anyone interested in achieving these outcomes\.\r\n- Dr Anna Mead\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more at: \r\nwww.minding.life","2021-05-18","2021-05-18","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","EXACT: minding - meditation timer (bad0627ffb444cbb899f0896c4a6b522)","Android, iOS","Free to Download, Payment, In-App Purchase","Own Your Own Data, Email or Export Your Data, Offline","","","Reminders, Summary of Data","","Has Privacy Policy, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Can Delete Data, Can Opt Out of Data Collection, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is PHI Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minding/id1438755887?ls=1","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lion.minding","","rbilden@bidmc.harvard.edu","rbilden@bidmc.harvard.edu","1621346749063","1621346749063"

CBT Tools for Kids is a unique app designed to help children and adolescents increase their emotional self-awareness and management of their feelings. CBT Tools allows children to learn and use effective strategies for understanding and managing their thoughts and feelings. These strategies are based on the principles of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), a scientifically-supported and well-established treatment for improving mood and managing emotions. CBT was developed by Aaron Beck in the 1960’s and is widely used by therapists around the country. CBT Tools was also designed as an addition or supplement to therapy, with the goals of encouraging greater compliance with self-monitoring homework and the use of CBT skills outside of the therapy office. CBT Tools is recommended for use by children ages 8 through 18. CBT Tools was developed by a clinical psychologist Ph.D. who specializes in the use of cognitive behavior therapy in practice with children and adolescents.  \n\nFEATURES:\n\nEmotion Tracker: The emotion tracker allows kids to 1) identify their current emotion; 2) rate the emotion’s intensity using a thermometer with various levels of intensity; 3) identify the situation that triggered the emotion by browsing categories or creating notes about the trigger situation; and 4) identify body sensations associated with the emotion. \n\nEmotion Graph and History Log: Colorful, simple graphs allow kids to view changes in the intensity of each emotion over the past week, past month, and past year. Kids can also view a full history of the emotion information they have entered. This allows children to make connections between the situations in their lives and the emotions they produce, as well as learn which situations result in stronger emotional responses. \n\nRelaxation Skills: The Relaxation Skills tool provides kids with five different audio clips that they can listen to during or after stressful situations to help them become calmer and manage stress. Activities include calm breathing, muscle relaxation, positive imagery, and awareness meditations.   Kids can save their favorite relaxation activities to their Favorite Tools page for easy access.\n\nThinking Skills: The Thinking Skills tool helps kids challenge negative thoughts related to a specific situation by first having kids answer a number of questions about the negative thought they currently have. Based on their answers, advice is provided that is specific to the distressing thought. The guidance provided helps kids question the accuracy of their thinking and challenge negative thoughts. Advice also gives ideas for positive actions they can take and more realistic and adaptive ways of thinking about the situation. Kids can save the advice they like best to their Favorite Tools page for easy access.\n\nPositive Actions: The Positive Actions tool provides kids with a list of positive actions and behaviors that can help them improve their feelings in the moment, reduce stress, or distract them from a problem that they cannot solve right away. Kids can save the positive actions they like best to their Favorite Tools page for easy access.\n\nEmail My Therapist: Email My Therapist allows kids to send their entered data over the past week to their therapist, school counselor, or another individual of their choice. Data sent includes the emotion, emotion intensity, situation that triggered the emotion, child’s notes about the situation, and any body sensations endorsed. This allows therapists quick and easy access to the child’s self-monitoring of their emotions, and can enhance compliance to self monitoring activities during therapy.","2020-06-15","2021-04-01","3","0","0","0","3","0","3","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","","iOS","Payment","Offline, Email or Export Your Data","Track Mood, Track Symptoms, Journaling, Deep Breathing, Psychoeducation","Surveys, Diary","References/Information, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data","Mood Disorders, Stress & Anxiety","","Self Help, Hybrid","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Audio/Music/Scripts, Collaborative With Provider/Other","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cbt-tools-for-youth/id596804744","","","slagan@bidmc.harvard.edu","slagan@bidmc.harvard.edu","1592191905217","1617284416418"

Flow represents a new chapter in the understanding and treatment of depression, based on the latest psychology and neuroscience research.\r\n\r\nDownload to use the Flow neural stimulator headset for depression treatment. Create a personal account and follow the instructions to start using the brain stimulation headset. The Flow headset is an approved medical device (CE) for depression treatment in the EU and UK. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com\r\n\r\nYou can go through the complete treatment programme with or without a Flow headset.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe programme contains over 50 sessions split into 7 courses on these topics and more:\r\n\r\n- Exercise​\r\n\r\nPhysically exercising to reduce and prevent depression has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication. Flow will tell you what kinds of exercise are most beneficial and what is the most optimal “dose”.\r\n\r\n- Meditation\r\n\r\nManaging stress is one of the most important things you can do. Meditation is practised by many people around the world as a mental “exercise” for the brain. Flow will give you concrete exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life.\r\n\r\n- Sleep​\r\n\r\nDid you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression.\r\n\r\n- Nutrition​\r\n\r\nThe nutrition sessions will advise and encourage you to eat in a way that science has proven reduces inflammation in the brain, thereby alleviating depression. Spoiler alert: sugar is one of the big villains.\r\n\r\nAlso includes a depression test.","2020-06-19","2020-12-24","3","0","0","0","2","1","3","true","Previously had approved versions that were removed/deleted or superseded by newer unapproved versions","PARTIAL: Flow - Depression treatment (ac159ac204d84021b2deea5b3a10a300)","Android, iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","","Track Mood","","","Phobias, Mood Disorders","Has Privacy Policy, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Can Opt Out of Data Collection, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Can Delete Data, Data Stored on Server","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Use Warning","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts, AI Support","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flow-depression/id1191476056","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flowneuroscience.flow.droid&hl=en_US","","vball354@yahoo.com","vball354@yahoo.com","1592583849900","1608852921705"

A simple mood tracker and a beautiful mood journal help you to stay on track with your thoughts and emotions.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\n- A dynamic monitoring recognizes symptoms of mental health disorders\r\n\r\n- Receive personalized recommendations based on your answers\r\n\r\n- Helpful insights and statistics help you to detect patterns and triggers\r\n\r\n- Psychological courses and mindfulness exercises can help you with mild and moderate symptoms\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nIf you experience symptoms of depression and anxiety like sadness, low self-esteem, brooding, fatigue or sleep problems, this is not uncommon. Ups and downs are a normal part of human psychology! But if you feel that these complaints last longer than a couple of days and they become a burden, you might want to check up on your mental health. MindDoc is a depression app that helps you track, monitor, and understand your complaints in a structured manner and, perhaps, find out which negative behavior could be connected with a worse well-being. At the end of the program, you will receive a detailed summary that you can also share with healthcare professionals, e.g. therapists, psychiatrists, or general physicians. During the screening period, you will find helpful information on psychology, signs of depression, therapy and mental health.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MindDoc\r\n\r\nThe app was developed with psychotherapists and scientists and can be used by anyone - whether as support in the context of regular psychotherapy or as free and anonymous help.\r\n\r\nYou can find more information about our terms of use here:\r\n\r\nhttps://mymoodpath.com/en/terms-services/\r\n\r\nHere you can learn more about our privacy policy:\r\nhttps://mymoodpath.com/en/privacy-policy/\r\n\r\nRegulatory Information\r\n\r\nMindDoc is a risk class I medical product according to the Council Directive 93/42/EEC Appendix IX.3 rule 12.

You are never asked for your real name and we’ll never disclose your personal information.\r\n• A variety of topics to choose from, including Marriage problems, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and many more.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY USE THERAPEER?\r\nYou're not alone: Everyone faces emotional issues from time to time. Research shows that sharing your experiences with others can be highly therapeutic for both you and the listener. Using Therapeer and participating in private support sessions provides an opportunity for people to share personal experiences and feelings, coping strategies, and to gain a sense of community and empowerment.\r\nYes, you can go to therapy - but time and place are rigid and it can be so expensive. We get it.\r\nYes, you can share your issues with your friends, but they don’t always have the time, energy, or ability to answer your emotional needs. We get that, too.\r\nYes, social network groups and in-person support groups can help, but there's no anonymity. There are certain issues you don’t want the whole world to know about. We TOTALLY get that.\r\nBut most of all: Other support group formats aren't focused on solving just one issue - everyone shares the stage. And there's no guarantee that anyone will even respond. Sometimes, you just want the focus to be on YOU.\r\n\r\nWe get all of that. We get YOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\r\n• Provide other community members with emotional support as a Peer. By doing so, it will help you deal with your own challenges in a broader perspective and will make you feel better by knowing you helped others in need.\r\n• Already gained the gratification of helping others? Go ahead and create your very own support room (or, if you don't want to wait, we offer the option to purchase a credit to open your room immediately).\r\n• After your private anonymous Support Room is opened, we match you with other Therapeer community members who have struggled with something similar to what you're experiencing. Peer assignment is based on your personal preferences and on the topic being discussed.\r\n\r\nJoin Therapeer today!

It's a real life saver... literally!\ - DG110378\r\n\I'm so glad to see someone help people who does DBT. VERY VERY good app.\ - celebration72\r\n\r\nDialectical Behavior Therapy Skills are a must, not just for people who have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), but for just about anyone living in this world alongside others.\r\n\r\nAre they necessary skills? No. Could anyone benefit from them? Yes.\r\n\r\nDBT Skills Groups are booked out weeks and often times months in advance. This means that if you want to get in one, you may be waiting for a long long time, especially if NOW is when you need help.\r\n\r\nDBT Skills Groups focus on SKILLS. This means that practicing the skills is much more important than anything else. And luckily, once you learn the skills, you will retain them for the rest of your life!\r\n\r\nIf you are practicing DBT Skills and want a Diary Card, this app is great for you since it has the following:\r\n• A Calendar to add a Daily Diary Card with 28 DBT skills.\r\n• Descriptions of each skill if you forget\r\n• Examples of each skill\r\n• Statistical information based on 1 day, 7 days, 28 days, or ALL records. That way if you are in a weekly DBT class, you can easily see which skills you have been focusing on, and which you have been missing.\r\n• A Notification reminder that you can set to remind you daily at a specific time to do your DBT Skills Diary Card.\r\n• Beautiful photos and artwork along with a backdrop that changes based on what season we are in (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring).\r\n• Add your own music to the DBT Skills Diary Card to make the experience more enjoyable.\r\n• Full Version Users: You can now send PDF files with your diary card stats + notes via email, or print to your AirPrint printer straight from within the app. Email your therapist/counselor with just a few taps in an easy to read and print format!\r\n• As part of our series of DBT apps, your progress will be saved between apps as well, so you'll have access to all your data no matter which DBT app you are in.\r\n• Unlock more than 1 type of Diary Card so you can continue doing your daily card in a format that fits your lifestyle!\r\n• Want to track extra information? Though DBT classes don't require it, you can add custom tracking data for each Daily Diary Card entry. Of course, since this is optional, you simply need to toggle it on to start tracking right away.\r\n    a) Track Anxiety and Depression using a modified K10 test.\r\n    b) Track Target Behaviors and your response to them.\r\n\r\nThis is the most enjoyable DBT Skills Diary Card in the App Store!

The app automatically tracks these measures using machine learning and helps to provide insight as to how certain activities throughout the day help boost your mood and keep it within balanced measures, all without user input.\n\nThe app is mainly for patients with bipolar disorder and helps track variability in mood as it goes up and down during day to day activities. By using machine learning, Companion learns about your day to day activity levels and starts to understand and recognize deviations from your normal, balanced mood. People with mood disorders need to track their mood and accompanying physiological and social well-being in order to better understand how their mood varies on a daily basis. Usually, the mood measurement is done on a scale from 0 - 10, 5 being a balanced mood, 0 is severe depression and 10 being manic.\n\nWhen deviations occur, the app will recognize these specific deviations (whether in sleep, activity levels or social engagement) and help offer tips and warnings to bring you back to a balanced mood measurement. As such, the app uses the most established, highly efficacious treatment style for patients with bipolar (Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy - IPSRT for short). IPSRT is integrated within the app in a way to keep track of your daily routine and disturbances to it. Early on, Companion will ask you multiple times a day what activity category you’re engaging in and will associate a mood with it. This helps Companion learn to automatically track your mood later on.\n\nTracking your mood as a patient with a mood disorder is extremely vital for you and your caretaker (psychiatrist or therapist) in helping you understand how certain deviations from a normal, balanced routine can lead to disturbances in your mood and subsequently, cause your depressive or manic symptoms to increase.","2020-05-15","2020-05-15","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","true","Has deleted records - implies previous approval before deletion","PARTIAL: Bipolar Mood Tracker° (e4c882bc97e648e29bfb74399c2bca50)","iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Track Mood, Track Medication, Physical Health, Track Sleep, Track Symptoms","Surveys","Reminders, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data","Mood Disorders","","Self Help","Does What it Claims, Well Written Relevant Content, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges)","","https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/companion-bipolar-mood-tracker/id1504120100","","","slagan@bidmc.harvard.edu","slagan@bidmc.harvard.edu","1589559592248","1589559592248"

Learn invaluable skills that will enable you to “slow down the wind-up” and control anxiety for the rest of your life. \r\n\r\nOur progressive 30-day program, with short daily exercises, will help you learn how your mind works, so you can change habits. You’ll learn how to switch gears the moment unwanted sensations and anxiety arise, and ultimately change the “habit-loop” that leads to anxiety. \r\n\r\nThe program was designed by Judson Brewer, MD, PhD, a renowned thought leader in the science of self-mastery. Dr. Brewer has 20 years of clinical and research experience at Yale and the Center of Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. His TED talks and lectures are popular worldwide.\r\n\r\nPRICING\r\n\r\nUnwinding Anxiety is free to download and use for 4 days. An in-app purchase allows access to all features and the remaining modules on an auto-renewing subscription basis*:\r\n\r\n1 month: $29.99\r\n6 months: $139.99\r\n1 year: $209.99\r\n\r\nAwareness and Anxiety Relief—one step at a time\r\nWith each step you’ll build momentum to the next one, gaining confidence one day at a time. As you progress, you’ll see from your own experience a sustainable change in your relationship with your emotions.\r\n\r\nLearn how to flex your mindful muscle\r\nAwareness methods empower you to turn-off your inner critic and turn-on your curiosity -- and by extension, feel better in the moment. Learning how to be kind to yourself isn’t easy, but it’s naturally rewarding, so your mind and body will want to do it again and again! \r\n\r\nGet in touch with your inner teacher\r\nOne user told us, “Unwinding Anxiety helped me find the inner teacher in me to learn how to change my relationship with anxiety and feel better about myself.” And, that’s just what this app was designed to do—put you in the driver’s seat to regulate and manage your response to anxiety.\r\n\r\nOwn your progress and feel the change\r\nWhen you keep track of your development, you own it. A progress analytic dashboard, daily exercises, along with a unique stress test help you chronicle your mood and anxiety levels throughout the day, so you gain invaluable insights into triggers and behaviors that occur in your body and mind.  You will end your day on a healthy note with specific practices before bed for a restful sleep.\r\n\r\nKey Features \r\n•\tYou’ll have access to experts, including Dr. Judson Brewer. \r\n•\tYou’re not alone. You can share your experience, ask questions and feel supported by those who “get” what you’re going through. \r\n•\tProven training exercises with video and recorded lessons put you in tune with your body&mind connection, so you can control your response to anxiety.\r\n•\tAn online journal helps you collect, analyze and manage your progress.\r\n\r\nBenefits \r\n•\tThe ability to adjust the things you can, instead of spinning your wheels over what you have no control over.\r\n•\tBecome more kind to yourself.\r\n•\tControl your response to anxiety.\r\n•\tFind joy living in the moment.\r\n\r\n*PRICING & TERMS\r\n\r\nAll prices are for U.S. customers. Pricing in other counties may vary and may be converted to your local currency.\r\n\r\nYour Unwinding Anxiety subscription will automatically renew at the end of each term unless canceled at least 24-hours before the end of term and your credit card will be charged through your Google Play account. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renew at any time in your Google Play Account Setting, but refunds will not be provided for the unused portion of the term.\r\n\r\nNeed help with the app?

The Mental Health Recovery Guide (MHRG) will tell you what they are.\r\n\r\nIf you suffer from depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and if you are a mental health outpatient, or a newly discharged psychiatric in-patient at the UK’s NHS or elsewhere in the world, MHRG will help you to get well and stay well.\r\n\r\nThe app is not just for the UK’s NHS patients but for the whole family of mental health sufferers everywhere. To date, it has been downloaded by users from 30 COUNTRIES around the world.\r\n\r\n• BEST INFORMATION & ADVICE FROM THE NHS & OTHER LEADERS\r\nThe app contains the most up-to-date evidence-based treatment, advice, support and self-help remedies that have proven to be successful with patients around the world, and that you can do yourself, without the need for a doctor. \r\n\r\nAll of MHRG’s featured information and advice has been obtained directly from the world’s leading healthcare institutions, including the NHS, the World Health Organisation, the European Food Standards Authority, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the New England Journal of Medicine and King’s College London.\r\n\r\n• SIMPLE TREATMENT REMEDIES YOU CAN DO YOURSELF\r\nAll of the Mental Health Recovery Guide’s advice is simple, and even fun. For example, how can dancing help with depression, or other forms of mental illness? How much water should you drink to improve your mental health? These and other questions are answered within our alternative guide to healing and self-betterment.\r\n\r\nOther healthcare topics cover diet, exercise, vitamins, positive thinking and love.\r\n\r\n• ‘SUPER VIEW’ OFFERS EXPANDED ADVICE, SUPPORT & TREATMENT\r\nThe Mental Health Recovery Guide’s 17 essentials are conveyed via a scrolling sequence of short, simple sentences. For deeper learning, each sentence is hyperlinked to a ‘super view’ — a connecting page featuring more detailed advice, support and self-help treatment options. As you scroll through the app, simply tap any sentence to access it. Super view is updated monthly with the latest treatment research results from around the world.\r\n\r\n• A DAILY REMINDER ABOUT YOUR HEALING\r\nUse the alarm feature to remind yourself to consult the app each day. Whether you suffer from depression, psychotic episodes or other psychiatric illness, let the Mental Health Recovery Guide frame your day and guide your healing actions.\r\n\r\n• CHANGE YOURSELF, CHANGE THE SYSTEM\r\nMHRG’s approach to mental health is one of self-help — of taking back your power to affect your own positive change.\r\n\r\nBy using MHRG to take responsibility for your own healing, you will be doing your bit to take the pressure off your country’s resources, thereby saving the NHS, or other healthcare system, money that can be re-deployed to support others like you.\r\n\r\nBy doing this you can change the system, and yourself.\r\n\r\nDownload now, and begin.\r\n\r\nMENTAL HEALTH RECOVERY GUIDE (MHRG): BEST FEATURES\r\n• 17 ESSENTIAL GUIDELINES: Covering diet, exercise, medication, positive thinking and love.\r\n• SUPER VIEW: Tap any of the guidelines to access expanded info about treatment and self-help remedies.\r\n• COOL STYLE: Information is presented in scrolling sentences of bold yellow type for enhanced impact.\r\n• DAILY REMINDER: Start your day right — set a time to read the app each morning.\r\n• CUSTOMISE YOUR LOOK: Choose from four background colours.\r\n\r\nMHRG is free. There are no pop-ups for ads or other purchases.
