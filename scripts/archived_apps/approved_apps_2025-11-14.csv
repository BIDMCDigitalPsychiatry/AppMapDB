The app has been developed with the full involvement of Professor Emily Simonoff, Dr Ann Ozsivadjian and Dr Rachel Kent from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London.\n\nMost autistic people experience anxiety on a regular basis. Around eight out of ten will have symptoms of anxiety – and of these, three or four will have enough symptoms to be given a diagnosis of anxiety disorder.\n\nMolehill Mountain allows you to track your worries and identify the situations that trigger your anxiety. Your daily check-ins are plotted on a chart which allows you to identify pattern and trends – and you can also display a previous check-in to help you identify recurring triggers for your anxiety.\n\nOver time, you unlock tips that will help you to understand your anxiety and learn ways to manage it. The daily tips have been completely rewritten for this new version of Molehill Mountain. In addition, we have added dozens of extra mini-tips to cover many of the common causes of anxiety and stress in autistic people, such as hypersensitivity to noise, light and touch or difficulties with social situations and communication.\n\nThe app also has interactive CBT activities which you can use at any time. These draw upon well-established and clinically proven techniques and are designed to help you to recognise and overcome unhelpful patterns of thinking. \n\nThe development of Molehill Mountain has been supported by:\n    •  The Maudsley Charity\n    •  The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists’ Charity\n    •  The Pixel Fund\n\n\nAutistica\n\nAutistica is the UK’s national autism research charity. They exist to create breakthroughs that enable every autistic person to live a happy, healthy and long life. They do so by:\n    •  Shaping and growing research across the UK \n    •  Funding new and innovative research solutions \n    •  Campaigning for better services and shaping national policy \n    •  Sharing evidence-based tools, resources, and information\n\nhttps://www.autistica.org.uk/\n\n\nThe Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London\n\nKing’s College London is one of the top 10 UK universities in the world (QS World University Rankings, 2018/19) and among the oldest in England. King’s has more than 31,000 students (including more than 12,800 postgraduates) from some 150 countries worldwide, and some 8,500 staff.\n\nThe Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London is the premier centre for mental health and related neurosciences research in Europe. It produces more highly cited outputs (top 1% citations) on mental health than any other centre (SciVal 2019) and on this metric we have risen from 16th (2014) to 4th (2019) in the world for highly cited neuroscience outputs. World-leading research from the IoPPN has made, and continues to make, an impact on how we understand, prevent and treat mental illness and other conditions that affect the brain.\n\nhttps://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/","2020-11-05","2025-11-09","2025-11-09","19","18","1","17","17","2","1","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, Totally Free","Email or Export Your Data, Own Your Own Data","Deep Breathing, Track Mood, Track Symptoms, Journaling, Psychoeducation, Goal Setting/Habits, Productivity","Surveys, Diary, Contact List","Notifications, References/Information, Reminders, Summary of Data, Graphs of Data","Stress & Anxiety","App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Data Stored on Server, Has Privacy Policy, Is PHI Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help, Kids Help Phone Approved","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency, Supporting Studies, Can Cause Harm","Academic Institution","Gamification (Points/Badges), User Generated Data, Network Support","","https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/molehill-mountain/id1407304564","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.mymolehillmountain.autistica","https://www.autistica.org.uk/molehill-mountain","rbilden@bidmc.harvard.edu","selzzt@bu.edu","1604591953664","1762713625574"

Unlike sleeping pills, our sleep monitor it helps to eliminate the underlying causes of sleeping problems and develop better sleep habits ✨.\n\n⭐️ HOW AVRORA WORKS\n\n⭐️ Falling Asleep:\nDeep calm breathing combined with relaxing sleep music and sleep sounds leads to the predominance of the processes of inhibition in the central nervous system. It allows Avrora to regulate pressure and heartbeat, focus attention on breathing, thereby distracting from unwanted thoughts and promoting better sleep. Deep and controlled breathing is evolutionarily associated with a feeling of rest and relaxation. In addition, soothing sleep sounds provide an opportunity to relax and get a positive emotion, effectively reducing the likelihood of excitation before sleep.\n\n⭐️ Sleep recording:\nOur sleep tracker app is also a snore recorder and sleep recorder which helps you track snoring and other sleep habits, including sleep apnea.\n\n⭐️ Sleep retention:\nBreathing techniques results in more reliable replacement of wakefulness rhythms (alpha and beta waves) with low-amplitude sleep waves (theta and delta waves), thus making sleep much more durable. Meditation sessions promote deep relaxation and mindfulness, bring the body to a deep and lasting sleep. Bedtime meditation qualitatively improves the most fragile REM phase, which allows you to complete a full sleep cycle and feel yourself full of energy in the morning.\n\n⭐️ Waking Up Refreshed:\nAfter a good deep sleep your body is restored and is ready to function in full. Our Smart Alarm analyzes your sleep patterns and wakes you up gently from the lightest phase in your sleep cycle. Pleasant alarm melodies allow you to wake up gently, gradually and with no stress. It is very important for mental wellness to live the first minutes of your day with positive emotions and thoughts.\n\n⭐️ Sleep Sounds\nOur sleep app offers a variety of nature sounds, sleep music, white noise, brown noise and pink noise options to choose from to ensure you can wind down from your stressful day, relieve anxiety and relax.\n\n⭐️ WHY DO YOU NEED AVRORA?\nAsk yourself the following questions:\n❓ Do you face difficulty getting to sleep or staying asleep?\n❓ Do you feel tired in the morning right after you wake up?\n❓ Do you have difficulty concentrating during the day?\n❓ Are you struggling to stay organized?\n❓ Do you feel so tired that all you can think about is sleep?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then you can definitely benefit from using the Avrora app for sleep and wellness.

Become a better sleeper and morning person thanks to 100 years of sleep science with RISE, the only sleep tracker that also measures your sleep debt and energy levels.\n\n\nRecommended by the Sleep Foundation and trusted by teams in the NFL, MLB, and NBA, and top Fortune 500 companies, RISE makes it easy to improve your sleep and energy.\n\n\nBut RISE is more than a sleep and energy tracker. Users can access widgets, calendar integration, sleeping sounds, meditation guides, smart alarm clocks, habit reminders, and a sleep knowledge library.\n\nFROM THE RISE COMMUNITY\n\n***\nChase M.\n\RISE helped me understand how vital sleep truly is. In only a few weeks, I found myself more focused, energetic, and productive at work.\\n\n***\nBecky G.\n\I could see where sleep debt was causing issues, like temper short, not comprehending things, moving slowly.  I had an epiphany... I'm getting 45min more sleep on average than I was before RISE.\\n\n\nUNLOCK BETTER SLEEP\nTired of the age-old \eight hours of shut-eye\ advice? Go beyond buying a new mattress or pillow and discover the life-changing concept of Sleep Debt.\n\nScientifically proven to be a vital factor in your well-being, a low Sleep Debt can improve your life quality and even your longevity—while high Sleep Debt can cause fatigue and harm your health.\n\nRISE calculates your Sleep Debt, helps you understand its impact on your energy, and guides you on how to lower it by improving sleeping habits. Learn about your melatonin window, when to prioritize sleep, and understand the real cost of those late nights—and how you can benefit from naps.\n\nPERSONALIZED SLEEP TRACKER\nDo you find your mind racing when your head hits the pillow? Can’t stop doom-scrolling on your phone? Feeling fatigued all day?\n\nBased on your sleep data, circadian rhythm, and the latest research, we’ll make recommendations that fit your needs and guide you toward healthier habits, making you a better sleeper.\n\nRISE will get you in bed on time, guide you when you can’t sleep, reduce the times you wake up at night, and make you feel less groggy in the morning.\n\nDISCOVER YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM\nWe all have an internal brain clock, our circadian rhythm, it signals to our body when to be alert or go into recovery mode. Everyone is unique, from when we perform our best to when we should sleep and wake up, so we use advanced algorithms to find your optimal sleep and activity window.\n\nYou’ll gain insight into your circadian rhythm and daily energy levels, helping you plan for a more productive day.\n\nSleeping refuels energy, and 83% of RISE users feel more energy in a week or less.\n\nAUTOMATICALLY TRACK SLEEP\nThrough our integration with Apple Health, Apple Watch, Fitbit, Oura, and data from other sleep trackers on your phone, like Sleep Cycle and ShutEye, RISE can determine the hours of sleep you get every night, your sleep debt, the number of steps you take each day, as well as data from other activities that affect your sleep pattern.\n\nWHY WE STARTED RISE\nWe want to help get ahead of the Insufficient Sleep Epidemic (CDC, 2014) we're experiencing, which has been steadily increasing since 1985. This Epidemic has led to elevated mortality rates (Cappuccio, 2010) as well as underperformance in most aspects of life (RAND, 2016).\n\n\nToday, we look at sleep as a luxury. RISE strives to create a world where healthy sleep is a necessity.\n\nSubscription pricing & terms\nRISE offers auto-renewing subscriptions to provide unlimited access to all premium features. There’s also a limited-time free trial of 7 days to explore the premium features for free.\n\nPayment will be charged to the credit card connected to your Play account when you confirm the initial subscription purchase.

It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! \n\nPersonally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What’s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... \n\nIt also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you've abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.\n\nFEATURES: \n\n• Food Journal / Diary \n\nIn addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.\n\nYou could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.\nAs a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.\n\nThere are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.\n\nAlthough individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan — no matter how flexible or structured — is necessary.\n\nThis tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA's Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.\nSource:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html\n\n\n• Gratitude List \nIf you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  \n\n* Hardship Discounts Available \n\nIn 2019, the OA WSBC accepted the following definitions:\n1. Abstinence: The act of refraining from compulsive eating and compulsive food behaviors while working towards or maintaining a healthy body weight.\n2. Recovery: Removal of the need to engage in compulsive eating behaviors.\n\nSpiritual, emotional, and physical recovery is achieved through working and living the Overeaters Anonymous Twelve Step Program.\n\n * Permission to use the OA name granted by Overeaters Anonymous, Inc.

If you’re finding it tough to stop, QuitNow is here to help you.\n\nFirst things first: you know smoking is harmful to your body. Despite this, many people continue to smoke. So, why should you quit? When you quit smoking, you enhance the quality and longevity of your life and the lives of those around you. One effective way to prepare for a successful smoke-free journey is to download QuitNow on your phone.\n\nQuitNow is a proven app designed to motivate you to quit smoking. It encourages you to avoid tobacco by helping you visualize yourself as a non-smoker. Quitting becomes easier when you focus on these four key areas:\n\n🗓️ Your ex-smoker status: When you quit smoking, the spotlight should be on you. Recall the day you quit, and crunch the numbers: how many days have you been smoke-free, how much money have you saved, and how many cigarettes have you avoided?\n\n🏆 Achievements: your motivations to quit smoking: Just like any other task in life, quitting smoking is easier when you break it down into smaller, manageable steps. QuitNow offers you 70 goals based on the cigarettes you’ve avoided, the days since your last smoke, and the money you’ve saved. This means you can start celebrating your accomplishments right from day one.\n\n💬 Community: the ex-smokers' chat: When you quit smoking, it’s important to stay in non-smoking environments. QuitNow provides a chat filled with people who, like you, have bid farewell to tobacco. Surrounding yourself with non-smokers will make your journey smoother.\n\n❤️ Your health as an ex-smoker: QuitNow gives you a list of health indicators that explain how your body improves day by day. These indicators are based on information from the World Health Organization, and we update them as soon as the WHO releases new data.\n\nAdditionally, there are more sections in the preferences screen that can support you on your quitting journey.\n\n🙋 Frequently Asked Questions: We’ve compiled some tips for quitting smoking, but honestly, we weren’t sure where to place them. Most people looking to quit seek advice online, and there’s a lot of misleading information out there. We researched the archives of the World Health Organization to find studies they’ve conducted and their conclusions. In the Frequently Asked Questions section, you’ll find answers to all your queries about quitting smoking.\n\n🤖 The QuitNow AI: Occasionally, you might have unusual questions that don’t appear in the FAQ. In those cases, feel free to ask the AI: we've trained it to respond to those quirky inquiries. If it doesn’t have a good answer, it will reach out to the QuitNow team, who will update their knowledge base so it can provide better responses in the future. By the way, yes: all of the AI’s answers are sourced from WHO archives, just like the tips in the FAQ.\n\n📚 Books to quit smoking: Familiarizing yourself with techniques for quitting smoking can make the process easier. There’s always someone talking about books in the chat, so we did some research to find out which ones are the most popular and which can genuinely help you quit for good.\n\n⌚ Also on your watch: QuitNow's Wear OS app and tiles let you track your progress, see how much you've saved, and check your smoke-free stats right from your wrist.\n\nDo you have any suggestions to make QuitNow even better?

Tell MoodMission how you’re feeling and it will give you a tailored list of 5 Missions that can help you feel better and improve your wellbeing. \n\nMissions are mental health strategies that are quick, easily achievable, and backed up by scientific evidence, including:\n★ Mindfulness meditations\n★ Relaxation\n★ Exercise and fitness activities\n★ Affirmations and coping statements\n★ Behavioural activation\n★ Yoga\n★ Gratitude\nAnd heaps of other proven mood boosting activities.\n\nIt's a simple as doing a Mission and boosting your mood.\n\nMoodMission is based in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which is an evidence-based psychological therapy for anxiety and depression. Anyone can use MoodMission, whether you just want a lift in your day or need a bit more help recovering from anxiety or depression.\n\nA randomised controlled trial has shown that MoodMission can improve mental health and wellbeing (Bakker et al., 2019), and two other studies published in scientific journals have provided further support (Bakker & Rickard, 2019; Bakker et al., 2018). Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard of scientific evidence, and very few available mental health apps have RCT support (Firth et al., 2018).\n\nCompleting Missions earns you rewards in the app, motivating you to take steps towards becoming healthier, happier, and more confident. Plus a Mission log helps you track your progress over time.\n\nMoodMission learns which types of Missions work best for you, so the more you use MoodMission the better it gets at tailoring your Mission suggestions.\n\nMoodMission is not a replacement for professional help. If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, or any mental health issue, talk to your GP or contact a psychologist for support.","2020-04-27","2025-09-14","2025-09-14","18","18","1","17","17","1","0","Android, iOS, Web","In-App Purchase, Free to Download, Subscription, Payment","Own Your Own Data","Track Mood, Psychoeducation, Productivity","Surveys","Summary of Data, References/Information, Notifications, Reminders","Mood Disorders, Stress & Anxiety","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Can Delete Data","Self Help, Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Supporting Studies, Use Warning, Can Cause Harm, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges), Assessments/Screenings","","https://apps.apple.com/au/app/moodmission/id1140332763","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.mood.mission","https://moodmission.com/","melissasvorster@gmail.com","selzzt@bu.edu","1588015668105","1757875695925"

Sleep hypnosis is a process of guiding your mind into a state of relaxation to fall asleep more easily. Hypnosis can be done with the help of the MindTastik sleep meditation app. \n\nSleep meditation involves focusing on your breath and letting go of all other thoughts. This can help to calm your mind and body, making it easier to fall asleep. Both relax hypnosis and meditation can be done in bed just before sleep. \n\nSelf Hypnosis and Guided Meditation for Anxiety\n\nFor many of us, anxiety is a constant battle. Whether it's looming deadlines at work, upcoming social obligations, or simply the stresses of daily life, it can be tough to keep our anxiety under control. But there are some simple things we can do to help ease our anxiety and bring us back to a place of calm. One of those things is self-hypnosis, a form of meditation that helps us focus and relax our minds. By focusing on positive affirmations and breathing deeply, we can enter into a state of relaxation hypnosis which allows us to let go of our anxieties and fears. \n\nMindfulness is another great tool for managing anxiety and stress. By being present in the moment and focusing on our breath, we can learn to control our thoughts and let go of the stressors that are causing our anxiety. \n\nBoth relax hypnosis and mindfulness are excellent tools for managing anxiety. \n\n▌Transform your life by using guided meditation, self-hypnosis, sleep sounds, and affirmations to eliminate negative thinking patterns from your subconscious.\n▌Learn mindfulness to get rid of intrusive thoughts and focus on the present moment.\n▌Learn new habits with our daily meditations or 7 days anxiety, sleep meditation, and relaxation challenges. The power of self-improvement lies in you!\n▌Use morning meditation, nature sounds, and our sleep sounds machine.\n\nRelax and Sleep Well Hypnosis Meditate App by MindTastik\n\nThere are a lot of free calming apps out there, but there is a great reason for you to try MindTastik Meditation App. It will help you relax and sleep well, and it's also great for managing stress and anxiety. The app includes a variety of guided meditations, and you can choose from several different relaxation techniques. There are also some great visualizations that you can use to help you relax.\n\nAll the other apps for anxiety are missing one point: integrating meditation techniques inside daily life. So, meditation becomes a temporary resort without helping the user acknowledge and be aware of his thoughts and feelings. MindTastik helps you by providing meditation and free mindfulness tips after each audio session you perform.\n\n▌The key to feeling calm and happy is to be conscious of your feelings. Learn how to meditate, sleep well, or have a better day!\n▌Take daily confrontations with fear to manage daily stress and anxiety more effectively.\n▌Gain inner strength to deal with difficult situations in a more positive way.\n\nDaily Meditation to Change Bad Habits\n\nMany people struggle with bad habits that they want to change, but it can be difficult to know where to start. There are many free meditation options available, but these apps also provide valuable guidance on how to get started with mindfulness. Daily meditation has been shown to effectively break bad habits by increasing self-awareness and promoting positive thinking. \n\n▌Use relaxation techniques to remove performance anxiety and public speaking fear.\n▌Start building confidence from within to exude it in your everyday life.\n\nDownload our Meditation App Today!\n\nTerms: https://mindtastik.com/terms.pdf\nPrivacy: https://mindtastik.com/privacy.pdf","2020-10-05","2025-09-12","2025-09-12","14","13","1","12","12","2","1","Android, iOS","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Offline","Psychoeducation, Deep Breathing","","Notifications, Reminders, References/Information","Non-Specific, Sleep","Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Has Privacy Policy, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared, App Reports Security Measures in Place","Self Help, Kids Help Phone Approved, Available in Canada","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts, Videos","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mindt-meditation-app-sleep/id1454780254","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Mindtastik.app","https://mindtastik.com/","slagan@bidmc.harvard.edu","aegbe@bu.edu","1601897464623","1757636956845"

Our charity, with the same name (ACT On It) created this app.\n\nWhy? To help young people improve their health and overall mental well-being.\n\nYou can say ACT like the word 'act'. It stands for Acceptance Commitment Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Training. This app is an introduction to ACT.\n\nACT is about you. It's suitable for almost anybody. We all need tips and tools to help us make the most out of life.\n\nIt's like this:\n\nOpen up to what is here and now, get clear about what's important to you, then act on it. This includes making space for the unhelpful thoughts and unwanted feelings that get in the way of us fully living our lives. Those thoughts and feelings that we all have from time to time.\n\nHere's some more info about thoughts, feelings and how this app ‘ACT On It’ can help:\n\nSome thoughts are helpful.\n\nBut science shows us that most of our automatic thoughts are not that helpful.\n\nOur minds are like a broken radio, skipping channels. When we're absorbed in the voices on this radio, they can take us away from fully connecting to life. This happens to every single human being from time to time.\n\nLife programmes us to be safe in our comfort zones. It also programmes us to try and get rid of uncomfortable emotions.\n\nBut this means we spend time caught up in our own struggles. When this happens, we tend to avoid things that matter to us deep down.\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy is about you taking hold of your life compass and living by the life you really want to live.\n\nSo, this is what this app is for. To take control of our lives more effectively by using some of the tools within this app.\n\nThese tools can empower us to unhook from our struggles with unhelpful thoughts and uncomfortable feelings. Then we have more space and energy to focus on the things in life that actually matter.\n\nThese things that we really care about.\n\nACT is for anybody that wants to\n\n• Explore what really matters to them and act on it\n\n• Use tools to help make space for unhelpful thoughts and uncomfortable feelings\n\n• Use tools to focus and engage more in the moment of now.\n\nIt doesn't matter who you are...\n\nACT can be for almost everybody.

People with bipolar disorder experience high and low moods (mania and depression, respectively) that are more extreme than what people typically experience. This can lead to a lot of stress and problems with family, work, money, and the law. This app contains a self-report questionnaire to help screen for symptoms related to bipolar disorder. It also contains information to help you get a better understanding of this mental illness.\n\nBipolar Disorder Test is designed to evaluate your symptoms of bipolar disorder with a scientifically-supported 15-question test. It uses the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), a screening questionnaire for bipolar spectrum disorder that is commonly used in research and healthcare settings.\n\nBipolar Test contains four tools:\n- Start Test: take the MDQ questionnaire to screen for bipolar disorder\n- Result: understand your test results and get resources tailored to your result\n- Information: learn about bipolar spectrum disorder and discover additional resources that can help you on your path to recovery\n\nDisclaimer: The MDQ is NOT a diagnostic test. A diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional.

We never want money to be the reason why someone can’t benefit from what we’ve built. \n \n**Created by Sam Harris\nSam Harris, neuroscientist and best-selling author, built Waking Up to be the resource he wished he’d had when he began exploring meditation over 30 years ago.\n \nSam only includes those practices and insights he’s found to be utterly life-changing. The same is true for the many teachers, scholars, and experts you’ll meet throughout the app.\n \n**A step-by-step approach to mindfulness\nWe’ve heard from thousands of members who say they never really understood meditation until they took our 28-part Introductory Course. \n \nWhether you’re a beginner or advanced practitioner, you’ll dive straight into the deep end of real mindfulness, so you don’t waste any time on the surface.\n \n**Learn the true purpose of meditation\nMeditation is about more than just relieving stress, sleeping better, or improving your focus. While it can help you do all of that, our goal is ultimately to help you open the door to a deeper understanding of yourself.\n \nHere, you won’t just uncover simple relaxation techniques —and you won’t find any New Age fluff or religious dogma. \n \n**A place for serious seekers\nExplore some of life’s most important questions, on topics like neuroscience, psychedelics, enlightenment, ethics, and Stoicism—from renowned authors and professors like Oliver Burkeman, Michael Pollan, Laurie Santos, Arthur C. Brooks, James Clear, and others.\n \n**In-depth theory and practice\nWaking Up explains both the theory and the practice of meditation —so you don’t just learn the “how” of mindfulness, but also the “why.” \n \nYou’ll be guided by prominent figures like Joseph Goldstein, Diana Winston, Adyashanti, Jayasāra, and Henry Shukman, who teach a wide range of contemplative practices, including Vipassana, Zen, Dzogchen, Advaita Vedanta, and more.\n \n**Timeless insights, modern lens\nWithin Waking Up, you’ll find some of the most profound spiritual teachings from throughout history—those that have stood the test of time. And you’ll hear from historic voices like Alan Watts.\n \nBut we also pressure-test ancient wisdom against modern science, so you won’t find outlandish claims or anything we haven’t found to be empirically true.\n \n**A comprehensive guide\nWaking Up supports your growth and development in a number of different ways. You’ll find an abundance of useful features, like meditation timers, in-app support messages, an ever-growing audio library, and daily reminders to help bring your mindfulness practice into your life.\n \n“Waking Up is, hands down, the most important meditation guide I’ve ever used.” Physician Peter Attia\n \n“If you’ve had trouble getting into meditation, this app is your answer!” -Susan Cain, best-selling author\n \n“Waking Up is not an app, it’s a path.

On this epic inner journey, you’ll reconnect with your wisest self and unlock a whole range of psychological powers:\n\n• Improve your emotional intelligence, self care and coping skills\n• Calm your nerves and soothe overwhelming feelings\n• Uncover new paths to self improvement, self actualization and growth\n• Tap into your subconscious mind through the power of story\n• Identify your values to increase your motivation, sense of gratitude and life purpose  \n• Deepen your self knowledge to help you in overcoming sadness, resentment, low self esteem, fixed mindset, negative perception, insecurities.\n\n💡 WHAT MAKES BETWIXT WORK\nBetwixt is a relaxing, de-stressing game that draws on decades of psychology research and therapeutic practice into how we feel, think and behave. It includes tools for emotion regulation and self reflection, journal prompts for mental health, elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), mindfulness approaches, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Jungian theory and others. Together, these methods work to improve your wellbeing, calm your mind, increase your self esteem and help you deal with challenging emotions. \n\n◆ An immersive experience\nIn Betwixt, you become the hero (or heroine) of an interactive adventure through a dreamlike world that responds to your thoughts and feelings. We’ve used immersive storytelling and sounds to create an alternative for people who find a CBT diary too dry, and struggle to engage with mindfulness, breathing or counseling apps, emotion trackers and mood journals. \n\nFor neurodivergent users, Betwixt stands out among ADHD apps for adults by offering a  creative, engaging approach that removes distractions, improves your focus, motivation and mindset without creating digital addiction.\n\n◆ Evidence-based\nIndependent psychology research shows that Betwixt can significantly reduce anxiety, stress and depression, with effects that can last months.

ACTIVITY PLANNER, which motivates the user to create a to-do list of tasks (check off, edit or delete the accomplished goals anytime) and WHAT MADE ME HAPPY to help the individual focus on the positives of the past day.\n\nThe module ANXIETY & PANIC ATTACKS aims on helping the user overcome intense feelings of anxiety and panic attacks. It includes two types of breathing exercises, designed to immediately help the individual to calm down. The first exercise focuses on deep breathing only – switching between inhaling and exhaling. The second exercise is focused on the ‚box breathing‘ technique– full inhale, holding your breath, full exhale and again holding your breath.\n\nAnother feature included in this module is COUNTING of simple mathematical equations to help the user focus on something other than the anxious thoughts and physical reactions that accompany each panic attack. The equations are automatically generated and include addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 0 to 9, and are immediately corrected. The last feature in this module includes more suggestions on what to do when feeling anxious (e.g. breathing exercise, count from 100 to 0, watch your favourite film etc.)\n\nThe module SELF HARM tries to distract from the urges. Once again it provides two breathing exercises. The feature WHAT CAN HELP ME includes suggestions what to do instead of hurting yourself (take an ice-cube or red marker and move it across your skin where you would usually hurt yourself, write down your emotions and describe how you feel and then destroy the piece of paper, scream, exercise or try to diffuse the intense emotions through painting or guided relaxation).\n\nThe SUICIDAL THOUGHTS module provides a list of reasons and activities and which could prevent the thoughts or at least show the value of one‘s life. The users create their own EMERGENCY PLANS. The app enables the user to make list of safe activities as an alternative scenario to follow in crisis. The plan includes: who will I contact, what will I say/write, what will I do or where will I go in case of an emergency. It is ideal to create the plan when one is able to think rationally or with the help of another person. This feature also includes a list of people who care about the individual and would potentially be hurt by his actions.\n\nIn the REASONS TO STAY ALIVE section, users can create a list of people, things and activities they like or care about enough to stop them from committing suicide. There are a few default entries in the list for users to have an idea what kind of reasons they might put in. And again – the breathing exercises are included in the SUICIDAL THOUGHT module.\n\nIn the last module – PROFESSIONAL HELP RESOURCES – there is a list of phone numbers with the option of directly calling the ambulance, hot lines and crisis centres. We also included links to chat rooms in case anyone prefers typing over speaking.\n\nThank you to Nevypusť duši for supporting our app.\n\nThe app is open-source with source codes available here: https://github.com/cesko-digital/nepanikar","2020-05-03","2025-08-04","2025-08-04","18","18","4","14","14","4","0","Android, iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Own Your Own Data, Email or Export Your Data, Offline, Accessibility","Journaling, Deep Breathing, Goal Setting/Habits, Track Sleep, Track Mood","Diary, Surveys, Contact List, Geolocation","Notifications, Summary of Data, Social Network, Reminders, References/Information","Non-Specific","Can Delete Data, Data Stored on Device, Has Privacy Policy","Self Help, Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Network Support, Gamification (Points/Badges), Real Time Response","","https://apps.apple.com/cz/app/dont-panic/id1459513911","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dontpanic&hl=en_US","","20069138@sun.ac.za","sdl182201@gmail.com","1588499214620","1754271993940"

This will help you have better deep sleep.\n\nTheta wave: Theta wave is a frequency of 4–7 Hz. It contributes to improved meditation, creativity, and sleep in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase.\n\nAlpha wave: Alpha wave is at a frequency of 7–13 Hz and may encourage relaxation.\n\nBeta wave: Beta wave is at a frequency of 13–30 Hz. This frequency range may help promote concentration and alertness.\n\nGamma wave: Gamma wave is a frequency higher than 30 Hz. These frequencies promote the maintenance of arousal while a person is awake.\n\nThese 5 brain waves work in different ways, but the basic principles are the same. It takes some time to work, so we strongly recommend listening to it for around 15 minutes every day.

Most accurate, fast and easy to use heart rate app.\n \nAPPLIED METHOD:\n\nOur app is based on photoplethysmography (PPG), non-invasive optical technique. Each heart beat transmits the amount of blood to the tissues in your fingers, while the blood absorbs your camera’s light, it illuminates the skin and captures microvascular blood volume changes such as ebb and flow. That allows you to measure the pulse easily, accurately and efficiently.\n \nHOW TO USE:\n\nCover the camera lens and flashlight with your fingertip completely. Do not press too intensively in order to avoid reducing blood flow. Hold your phone steady and keep still. Make sure your fingers are not cold. Press the button and get your results.\n \nTRACK YOUR MEASUREMENTS:\n\nGet visual display of the data at the given period of time. Personal dashboard with your measurement history.\n \nHEALTH KIT INTEGRATION:\n\nSupport for sharing heart rate results with Apple Health App.\n \nREMINDER:\n\nReceive notifications in order to have your finger on the pulse. Staying healthy and fit is a systematic process.\n \nIMPROVE YOUR PERFORMANCE:\nTrack your workout effectiveness to get in shape, improve your endurance and general wellness.\n \nNEVER MISS A BEAT!\n \nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n \nYearly subscription with 3-day free trial period will give you full access to \n* Unlimited measurements per day, \n* Monthly statistics,\n* Health insights, \n* No ads.\n \nDisclaimer: App measurements are just recommendations and can’t be used for diagnostics or medical purpose.

A virtual therapist provides professional guidance during the quitting process and helps smokers to overcome withdrawal symptoms.\n\nAdiquit has been created by an international team of leading experts on addiction treatment from Europe and the USA. The app is based on a complex professional support of smokers that is commonly used in therapist practice.\n\nClinical studies show the chance of quitting successfully with Adiquit is as much as six times greater compared to quitting without any professional help. You’re saving your time using Adiquit - there is a professional support always at hand.\n\nSmoking is an addiction and quitting is harsh. Majority of unsuccessful attempts are caused by the lack of information on the principles of addiction and insufficient preparation. Thorough preparation and professional support are therefore crucial during quitting.\n\nAdiquit is a cigarette addiction specialist, however, it also covers other tobacco and nicotine products.\n\nHow does Adiquit work and why does it reach such amazing results?\n- It adapts the therapy to meet your individual needs.\n- The programme starts with a ten-days preparation, then six weeks long quitting therapy follows.\n- There is an everyday short dialogue with the virtual therapist.\n- It supports you at the beginning but also during your quitting.\n- It inspires you and motivates you to reach your goal of becoming a non-smoker.\n- There is a quick aid at hand when you feel sudden cravings.\n- Adiquit won’t let you down when you accidentally smoke.\n- It provides an overview of your successes and progress.\n- It gives you advice on supplementary treatment.\n\nAdiquit intentionally doesn’t include any advertising that could bother you and distract you from quitting.\n\nAdiquit is based on long-term research and clinical practice. Adiquit is the most efficient help available on the market and you will reach maximal possible effect in combination with nicotine supplements and pharmacotherapy - that is why it is not available for free.\n\nYou can get the full version without ads and other fees for significantly less than is the average monthly amount spent on cigarettes. Besides, you can use the half-price offer after a two-days in the trial.\n\nEach day without cigarettes counts - download the Adiquit app now.\n\nMore information on the app, its creators and the quitting methods available at:\nhttps://www.adiquit.cz/\nFollow us on social media where you can find much more about smoking and its harmful effects:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Adiquithelps/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/__adiquit__/\nhttps://twitter.com/AdiquitTo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/adiquit/","2021-08-17","2025-07-21","2025-07-21","13","12","0","12","12","1","1","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Payment","Spanish, Own Your Own Data","Psychoeducation, Goal Setting/Habits, Bbot Interaction, Track Symptoms, Peer Support","Surveys, Camera","Notifications, References/Information, Summary of Data, Reminders","Substance Use (Smoking & Tobacco)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Gamification (Points/Badges), AI Support, Chat/Message","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adiquit-quit-smoking/id1456264845","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adiquit.android.app&hl=en_US&gl=US","https://www.adiquit.cz/en/home/","miltontnguyen@gmail.com","selzzt@bu.edu","1629179065798","1753062797296"

Built for iPad, iPhone, Android, OSI Connect is portable and provides information and assistance at the touch of a button.\n\nPTSD, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse are all types of operational stress injuries (OSI).  Canadian veterans and RCMP need to know that OSI Clinics across Canada specialize in treating these conditions that come from combat, grief, high stress situations or operational fatigue.  We are here to help you and your family. \n\nRecognizing that you need help, and getting the help you need, takes real courage.\n\nCheck out the details to start feeling better soon. \n\nAn operational stress injury (OSI) is any persistent psychological difficulty resulting from operational duties performed during military or RCMP service. It includes a range of health problems such as anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as well as other conditions that may be less severe, but still interfere with daily functioning.\n\nMany experiences can cause operational stress. Although active combat is certainly one of them, there are many other events that are part of the risk of serving in the military or RCMP that can cause such injuries. Taking part in search-and-rescue operations, being involved in a training accident, handling injured bodies, witnessing civilian atrocities or being involved in civilian disaster aid can all cause moderate to severe stress reactions. When these experiences interfere with a person's life, the result is an operational stress injury.\n\nAn OSI can affect others in the person's life, leading to marital and family problems. OSIs can also produce physical symptoms such as stomach upset, headaches, and sleep problems, and they can make chronic pain problems worse.\n\nCanada has a network of specialized clinics designed to successfully treat operational stress injuries of veterans and RCMP.  The clinics are committed to four key areas - assessment, treatment, networking and research in its efforts to understand and successfully treat clients and their families who have operational stress injuries. \n\nEach clinic has a dedicated professional team that includes psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental health nurses, and other specialized clinicians. They use their knowledge of the military and police cultures to develop personalized treatment plans in collaboration with each client. The spouse and close family members can also be involved in the treatment process.\n\nThrough this specialized treatment, clients address difficulties, develop treatment objectives, find resources, and improve their quality of life. While continuing to live in their community, clients attend periodic appointments at the OSI clinic except for the residential and inpatient stabilization treatment programs.\n\nIn addition to clinical assessment, clients are offered a variety of treatment options including individual therapies, group sessions, psycho-education sessions and access to other resources. Clients may be referred to an addiction treatment centre for specialized counselling services if alcohol dependency, substance abuse, or gambling difficulties require more intensive treatment.\n\nClients must be referred to one of the OSI Clinics by Veteran Affairs Canada, Canadian Forces or RCMP.    \n\nRegular and Reserve Members of Canadian Forces: Speak with your Medical Officer or Social Worker on the Base to discuss your concern.  \n\nCurrent members of the RCMP: Speak with your Health Services Officer or RCMP Psychologist.  \n\nRetired Canadian Forces or retired RCMP: Speak with Veterans Affairs Canada National Client Contact Centre at: English: 1-866-522-2122 French: 1-866-522-2022 \n\nTo talk to a Peer Support Coordinator, call the Operational Stress Injury Social Support (OSISS) Program at 1-800-883-6094","2024-09-06","2025-07-16","2025-07-16","5","5","0","5","5","0","0","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, Totally Free","Spanish","Psychoeducation","Geolocation","Notifications, References/Information","Mood Disorders, Non-Specific, PTSD, Substance Use","App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Can Delete Data, Can Opt Out of Data Collection, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Data Stored on Device","Self Help, Kids Help Phone Approved, Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","Government, Healthcare Company","Assessments/Screenings, Videos","","https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/osi-connect/id1364201381","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.royalottawa.osiconnect&hl=en_CA","https://www.veterans.gc.ca/en/about-vac/resources/stay-connected/mobile-applications/osi-connect","shreya.sharma@kidshelpphone.ca","emma.martin@kidshelpphone.ca","1725652770399","1752695144234"

Food Addiction Calendar automatically calculates how much money you have saved since you quit binge eating.\n10. Our motivational quotes and testimonials will ensure that you are not alone on this process to shake dependence on binge eating and overeating.\n \n \nHere are our top 7 reasons to stop being addicted to food:\n \n1. You eat way more food than you intended to\n \nBeing addicted to food means that you will keep eating, even when your stomach says that you are full. This is why food addiction is not only physical, but it is psychological as well.\n \n2. You experience food cravings even after being full\n \nGetting food cravings is not uncommon. However, having a food addiction means that you experience those cravings even when your stomach is packed full of food. This can be mentally draining.\n \n3. Feelings of guilt and regret\n \nMany overeaters will experience guilt after eating large quantities of food, as most people do. The problem is that people addicted to food will quickly get over that feeling and do it over and over again.\n \n4. Excessive weight gain\n \nWhen you are addicted to food, you keep eating, even when your body tells you not to. This creates a surplus of calories in your body, which leads to weight gain, which is mostly fat.\n \n5. Do you make up excuses for eating too much?\n \n“I’ll only have a few” and “just for today” are things that we tell ourselves all the time when we know we shouldn’t be eating something. When we repeat these mistakes over and over, we just feed the food addiction, and things won’t get better until you take a stand.\n \n6. Imagine how much money you will save\n \nI like to use the example of a pizza. Someone addicted to food might eat the whole pizza in one sitting, but someone conscious of their food intake may eat half the pizza and save the other half. 2 meals for the price of one! Make it happen.\n \n7. You keep failing the rules that you set for yourself\n \nIf you are addicted to food, you will habitually break the rules that you set for yourself to cut back eating. It will be difficult at first with hunger cravings, but your stomach will eventually adapt to the decrease in consumption. Your health will thank you.\n \n....If you are guilty of being addicted to food or binge eating, download Food Addiction Calendar for FREE now!","2023-06-19","2025-07-14","2025-07-14","6","6","1","5","5","1","0","Android, iOS","Free to Download, Subscription, In-App Purchase","Offline, Email or Export Your Data","Productivity, Peer Support, Track Symptoms, Goal Setting/Habits, Journaling","Social Network, Diary","Notifications, Social Network, Reminders, Summary of Data","Eating Disorders","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Can Cause Harm","For Profit Company","Gamification (Points/Badges), Audio/Music/Scripts, Peer Support, Network Support","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/food-addiction-calendar/id1112385170","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FoodAddiction.Calendar&hl=en_US&gl=US","","kparkher@bu.edu","sdl182201@gmail.com","1687144843428","1752460395976"

Sleep Monitor also has a smart alarm clock to remind you to sleep early at night and wake you up gently in the morning. In addition, Sleep Monitor provides relaxing sleep music to help you sleep better.  \n \nKey Features:\n 📊- New Feature: Sleep Trends\nImprove sleep quality and develop better sleep habits with weekly and monthly data statistics.\n\n🎙- Record Snoring or Dream Talking\nSleep Monitor will record snoring and grinding sounds made during your sleep, listen to them, and find more about your sleep the next morning! For fun!\n \n💤- Mark Your Sleep Habits\nIf you drink, eat, exercise, have any pathological condition or depressed emotions before sleep, see how these slumber habits can impact your sleep.\n \n📲- Track Your Sleep Phases\nSleepers will have 4 or 5 sleep cycles during the night. Usually, sleepers will pass four sleep stages in one sleep cycle: Non-REM 1(between waking and sleep), Non-REM 2(light sleep), Non-REM 3(deep sleep), and REM (Rapid Eye Movement, when most dreaming happens) sleep. These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1. A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes, with each stage lasting between 5 to 25 minutes.\n \nSleep Monitor uses both microphone and accelerator sensors to measure body movements and environmental noise changes and then recognize your sleep stages.\n \n📈- Get Your Sleep Score\nSleep Monitor will generate useful information for you after tracking, like sleep score, sleep cycle graphic, sleep statistics, sleep noise audios. Get your daily, weekly, or monthly sleep insights and use those data to help you sleep better. Sleep Monitor is especially helpful for those who want a way to check how their sleep is, and do not want to invest in an accessory like a smart band or smartwatch.\n \n⏰ - Set Smart Alarm Clock\nSet an alarm for your morning wake-up or nap or set a reminder for bedtime.\n \n🎵- Listen to Soothing Lullabies\nSuffering from insomnia?

Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\n\n\nThere are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.\n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.\n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n*It works on Wear OS: you can use it on your watch.","2020-05-20","2025-06-29","2025-06-29","17","15","0","15","15","2","2","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Offline, Spanish, Accessibility, Own Your Own Data","Picture Gallery/Hope Board, Goal Setting/Habits, Journaling","Surveys, External Devices","Notifications, Reminders, Social Network, Summary of Data","Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Can Delete Data, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts, Gamification (Points/Badges)","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-am-positive-affirmations/id874656917","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hrd.iam&hl=en_ZA","https://theiam.app/","michelle@mckenzie.co.za","yacoub.d@northeastern.edu","1589977173836","1751157336344"

So far, researchers have found benefits for those with inattention but not impulsivity, but the benefits of white noise don’t continue when it is no longer present. In the real world, people cannot control the sounds that surround them throughout the day. Although researchers are exploring whether white noise may provide complementary support for some people with inattentive ADHD, the evidence is inconclusive.\n\nResearch on white noise for inattentive ADHD\n\nMost research on white noise has focused on children still in elementary or middle school; however, the results seem to be applicable also to teens and adults.

It aims to improve mental well-being and self-esteem. \nYou can select different program packages depending on the issues you want to work on. For example, one of the program packages is specifically designed for people with a gambling problem. Another program package is intended for people who have psychotic experiences (ideally, this program package should be used along with Metacognitive Training for Psychosis (MCT), available at no cost from  uke.de/mct. The app is not meant as a substitute for psychotherapy. \n\nScientific studies confirm the effectiveness of the app on emotional problems and self-esteem (Lüdtke et al., 2018, Psychiatry Research; Bruhns et al., 2021, JMIR). The self-help exercises used in the app are based on scientifically recognized techniques of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) as well as Metacognitive Training (MCT) that reduce emotional problems such as sadness and loneliness and also improve problems with impulse control. Each day, you will receive new exercises. The exercises take just a few minutes and can easily be integrated into your everyday life. Up to two push messages will remind you to do the exercises regularly (optional feature). You will also be able to write your own exercises or to modify existing exercises. So, you can turn the app into your personal “guardian angel.” However, the app does not automatically adapt to the user's behavior (a learning algorithm has not been included).\n\nTaking care of your mental well-being is a bit like brushing your teeth: you have to do the exercises regularly so that they become routine and change your mood. Therefore, the app tries to support you in carrying out the self-help exercises as regularly as possible so that they become second nature and change your mental state. Reading about and understanding a problem are helpful but not sufficient and usually do not lead to any lasting changes. You will benefit the most from the app if you actively participate and practice continuously! The exercises are repeated over time. This is good! Only through regular repetition is it possible to overcome difficulties permanently. \n\nImportant note: The self-help app cannot replace psychotherapy and is intended solely as a self-help approach. The self-help app is not an appropriate treatment for acute life crises or suicidal tendencies. In the event of an acute crisis, please seek professional help.\n\n- This app needs access to your Photo Library to include images in your exercises (optional feature). \n- This app needs access to your Camera to include photos in your exercises (optional feature).","2023-05-15","2025-06-20","2025-06-20","8","8","1","7","7","1","0","Android, iOS","Free to Download, Totally Free","Own Your Own Data, Spanish, Offline, Email or Export Your Data","Journaling, Deep Breathing, Physical Health, Psychoeducation","Camera, Diary","Notifications, Reminders, References/Information, Summary of Data, Graphs of Data","Non-Specific, OCD, Sleep, Stress & Anxiety, Substance Use, Pain","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is PHI Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Can Opt Out of Data Collection","Self Help, Kids Help Phone Approved","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning, Supporting Studies, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency","Healthcare Company, Academic Institution","Gamification (Points/Badges), User Generated Data","","https://apps.apple.com/app/id1557322291","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.uke.cogitoapp&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1","https://clinical-neuropsychology.de/cogito-en/","nalon@bidmc.harvard.edu","celeste.carter@kidshelpphone.ca","1684159655097","1750428397027"

You can also see exactly how much money and time you save by staying clean and not drinking alcohol or not using drugs, so you'll be able to reward yourself with something nice when you have been sober for a long enough time. The app allows you to set up a sober counter, so you can track how many days in a row you've been sober. This is a useful tool for anyone who has trouble staying away from alcohol and other drugs and needs the motivation to stay clean. Count your clean days and celebrate when they hit double digits!\n\nAddiction Tracker.\nQuitzilla will help you get the support you need when recovering from addiction. It gives you a safe place to log your struggles and provides a tool to reframe those challenges into challenges worth overcoming. Commit to quit that habit! Enter your bad habit or addiction into the program easily.

From then on you can get tons of interesting statistics about it. The abstinence time and money saved are the leading statistics. \n\nRewards.\nThe rewards feature is actually a calculation of the money saved. For example, if you’ve spent $100 on gambling weekly, and you haven’t gambled for a week, then those $100 is your weekly reward. Users can also manually add rewards for themselves.

This, in turn, leads to increased self-control and problem solving abilities.  \n\n**The Zones of Regulation is a recipient of the prestigious Mom’s Choice Award\n**Seen on The History Channel & Bio Network\n\nIntroducing the Zones Picture Studio!  Team up and learn emotional awareness by taking pictures with your device. Scenarios are presented to students providing them the opportunity to reflect on how the scenario would make their body feel. Thinking about the cues from their body and brain, students use the app to capture what the feeling looks like on them, gaining insights on the physiological cues that accompany emotions. All pictures will be taken with your device's camera, stored on your device, and displayed directly in the app for easy review. Students can even create their own scenarios. The Zones Picture Studio offers hours upon hours of fun and education. \n\nLeah Kuypers is the author of the book, The Zones of Regulation (2011, Social Thinking Publishing).  The Zones of Regulation was featured as a promising practice in Attention Magazine and is being implemented school wide in districts across the United States and Canada.\n\nThe Zones assists students in conceptualizing how they are feeling by creating a system to categorize their emotions and levels of alertness into one of four zones.  Using a cognitive behavior approach, the App's learning activities are designed to help students recognize when they are in different zones, with each of the four zones represented by a different color.  \n\nThe Zones is designed to be used with elementary students, secondary students, and adults.  \n\nThroughout the App, students learn how to use strategies or tools to manage their feelings and behaviors in each zone.  Given each student's needs and preferences are unique, students explore various calming techniques, cognitive strategies, and sensory supports, building a toolbox of methods to use to regulate and move between zones.  \n\nHowever, self-regulation takes a lot more than knowing about tools.  To deepen students' understanding of how to self-regulate, the App also explores how triggers or different events can impact how they are feeling.  \n\nThe App highlights how to read others' facial expressions and recognize a broader range of emotions and perspectives about how others see and react to their behavior, insight into events that trigger their different zones, and when and how to use tools and problem solving skills to change the way they are thinking and feeling.\n\nThe App provides a fun, and engaging experience while learning and gaining valuable knowledge to assist in developing real-life skills.  Students will be taken on an adventure throughout a town filled with excitement, rewards, and mini games.  \n\nTo enhance learning, it is recommended that an adult closely monitor the student's progression through the App, asking probing questions and facilitating discussions about how the App's content can be generalized to the student's real life.  The content of the App can be further explored using the lessons and learning activities featured in the curriculum book, The Zones of Regulation.\n\nDownload The Zones of Regulation today!","2024-12-16","2025-06-16","2025-06-16","2","2","0","2","2","0","0","iOS, Web","Payment","","Deep Breathing","","Notifications, References/Information","Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Is De-Identified Data Shared, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Can Opt Out of Data Collection","Self Help, Kids Help Phone Approved","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Gamification (Points/Badges), Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/the-zones-of-regulation/id610272864","","https://zonesofregulation.com/explore-and-purchase-the-zones-products/","shreya.sharma@kidshelpphone.ca","yacoub.d@northeastern.edu","1734381481693","1750089794804"

Choose a treatment, then relax and listen to the sessions. HelloMind helps you take back control from negative emotions, cravings, fears and bad habits and it can improve your motivation and enjoyment of life. \n\nLow self-esteem, stress, fear, bad sleep and unhealthy habits sometimes hold us back in life and prevent us from enjoying things to the fullest. \nThe good news is these negative patterns can be broken or eliminated. \n\nWe created the HelloMind app to help you make a change. We want you to be able to think better and feel stronger anywhere, any time without having to spend a lot of time and money on treatment. \n\nThe key to happiness lies within you, and HelloMind works because you are making the change yourself. \n\nChoose a treatment with 10 sessions if you want help to remove or change something like a craving, a habit or a fear. Each session takes about 30 minutes, and your series of 10 sessions should be completed within about 30 days.\n\nChoose a Booster if you’d like to reinforce good emotions boost motivation or strengthen a certain area of yourself.\n\nHelloMind uses a method called RDH - Result Driven Hypnosis, a form of guided hypnosis.\n\nRDH is especially effective because it helps you go to the root cause of your problem. The theory behind it says that when you’re consciously able to define the problem, your subconscious can find the solution. That’s why you’re gently guided into your subconscious towards the root of your problem then given the tool to fix it.\n\nThe ten sessions in a treatment or the sessions in a Booster are variations on the same theme, so you’ll hear something different every time you listen. But listening to all 10 sessions in treatment is the only way to ensure that you go deep enough into your subconscious to discover the root of the problem. Every time you listen, you’ll feel a little more safe, because the process is underway and you’ve become accustomed to it.

Want to learn how to become more successful and enjoy the power of inner-monologue?\n\nIMPROVING SELF LOVE AND SELF ESTEEM IS SIMPLE\nThrow away your negative thoughts. Accept your positive thoughts. Learn to identify your inner conversation and respond to real life thoughts. Train daily and improve your self esteem and wellness.\n\nSCIENCE BACKED\nThe app is shown to improve supportive thinking and reduce maladaptive beliefs in 7 published academic papers.\nAccording to CBT models, negative self talk – individuals’ ongoing interpretations of the self, others and the world - maintain psychological difficulties such as low self esteem, mood, and maladaptive behaviours.\n\nHOW DO I FEEL SELF LOVE\nThe foundations of healthy self worth and self esteem are built upon beliefs. Our beliefs have the potential to bias and affect our ability to deal with daily situations. For example, if I believe that \everything in my life needs to be prefect\, I won't be able to live up to these expectations and my confidence will decrease.\n\nBELIEFS AND SELF TALK\nBeliefs and self talk are interrelated. With daily affirmations, we learn to embrace healthier and more adaptive self-talk. We can change our beliefs and get rid of thinking patterns that negatively affect our confidence and self-esteem.\n\nHOW THE APP WORKS\nThe app is designed to:\n1. Increase your awareness of negative thoughts\n2. Train you to identify and challenge negative thoughts\n3. Increase your daily access to affirmations and supportive thoughts\n4. Increase the automaticity of helpful thinking\n5. Provide daily affirmations for confidence and self-esteem boost\n\nIS THIS APP SIMILAR TO PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY?\nOur app platform is not designed to be used as a therapy or treatment, however:\n1. It is being used by CBT therapists as a complementing tool.\n2. It helps in maintaining self esteem during or after therapy.\n3. It is found to relieve symptoms of anxiety, worries, obsessions and more. \n\nGET TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS\nThe basic task in the app is simple - you will be presented with thoughts. If the thought promotes negative self talk - throw it away by dragging it on-screen. If the thought promotes positive or neutral thinking, accept it by dragging it towards you.\nThe more we train, the more automatic this process becomes.\n \nHOW MUCH SHOULD I TRAIN EACH DAY?\nTo feel better and improve your confidence, start today! We believe apps allow us to learn and train quickly and effectively. GG Apps are designed to be most effective in short training sessions. You are advised to complete up to 3 levels per day, which should only take between 2-4 minutes.\n\nBEGIN YOUR JOURNEY TO SELF LOVE\nThe app's many topics and themes are broken down into more than 500 levels. Each level has a pool of self-talk thoughts. Users are required to complete a random set of 'thoughts' to complete the level.\nTo further strengthen learning of supportive self-talk, each level the player completes is followed by a memory game in which one has to identify a supportive statements that appeared in the previous level.\n\nThe topics include: self esteem, belief in change, self criticism, negative thinking, coping, positive boost, comparing, perfectionism, emotions, social fears, self as an object, danger and threat, seeing the beauty, fear of abandonment, and more.\n\nYou can also test yourself to see how well your confidence progresses with our self assessment tool.\n\nTraining using this application, allows for gradual, steady learning of more adaptive self-talk thereby helping to break the vicious thought cycle maintaining low self-esteem.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT THE FACTS BEHIND GGTUDE APPS\nVisit our website: http://ggapps.net\n\nOTHER APPS BY GG\nGG Self Care & Mood Tracker\nGG OCD Anxiety & Depression\nGGBI: Body Image Distress & Preoccupation","2020-05-05","2025-06-01","2025-06-01","15","14","1","13","13","2","1","Android, iOS","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription, Payment","Own Your Own Data, Offline, Accessibility","Track Mood, Journaling, Goal Setting/Habits, Deep Breathing","Surveys","Notifications, Reminders, References/Information, Summary of Data","Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Can Delete Data, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Can Opt Out of Data Collection","Self Help, Kids Help Phone Approved","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Gamification (Points/Badges), User Generated Data, Audio/Music/Scripts, Videos","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gg-confidence-self-esteem/id1300107718","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.samuramu.gg.se","","24322865@sun.ac.za","sdl182201@gmail.com","1588697548213","1748749402745"

The sessions cover a range of topics from behavioural coaching and lifestyle habits, such as, meditation, sleep, diet and exercise. To track changes over time, the app includes the MADRS-s depression test.\n\nUsed as a companion tool for the Flow brain stimulation headset, this is a holistic approach to treating depression. The type of stimulation used in the Flow headset, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has long been used in clinical settings to treat depression. With Flow, you can now access tDCS in a remote device from your own home. To use the headset you will need the app.\n\nThe Flow treatment is based on decades of clinical research and is supported by more than 20 randomised double-blind studies. The Flow headset is approved as a medical device (CE) in the EU and UK for the treatment of depression. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com\n\nThe programme contains over 50 education sessions split into 7 courses, covering topics such as:\n\n- Exercise\n\nPhysical exercise has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication when it comes to reducing and preventing depressive symptoms. Flow education explores the types of exercise that are beneficial.\n\n- Meditation\n\nMeditation is practised by many people around the world as mental “exercise” for the brain. Flow will give you exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life.\n\n- Sleep\n\nDid you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression.\n\n- Nutrition\n\nThe nutrition sessions will advise and encourage you to eat in a way that science has proven reduces inflammation in the brain, thereby alleviating depression. Spoiler alert: sugar is one of the big villains.","2020-11-02","2025-06-01","2025-06-01","16","15","1","14","14","2","1","iOS, Web, Android","Free to Download, Totally Free","Accessibility, Own Your Own Data","Deep Breathing, Psychoeducation, Track Symptoms, Identify New Conditions, Coach/Therapist Connection","Surveys, External Devices","Notifications, References/Information, Reminders, Summary of Data, Graphs of Data, Link to Formal Care/Coaching","Mood Disorders","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, App Reports Security Measures in Place, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Can Delete Data, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help, Reference","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency","For Profit Company","Assessments/Screenings, Real Time Response, Gamification (Points/Badges), User Generated Data, Videos, AI Support, Chat/Message","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flow-depression/id1191476056","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flowneuroscience.flow.droid&hl=en_US","https://www.flowneuroscience.com/","rbilden@bidmc.harvard.edu","sdl182201@gmail.com","1604349058776","1748750943873"

You’ll also be able to see a bunch of cool statistics for each habit, such as your current and longest streak and your yearly and all-time completion rates.\n\nAny great new skill requires at least a few months of practice before you begin to see solid results: learning an instrument, getting back into shape, taking up a new language, etc. Focus on doing a little bit every day, log it in the app, and within a few months you’ll start to see incredible progress.\n\nBuild good habits, break bad habits, and achieve greatness!\n\n• Practice Better\nEvoday encourages you to practice better with its progress tracking feature. Giving up on your dreams will be harder to do when you see how long your current streaks are, and how much  practice you’ve put in so far. Visualize your progress on a yearly calendar and get reports for each habit with your current and longest streak, as well as your yearly and all-time completion rates. \n\n• Make your Home Screen shine with widgets\nThe app offer a wide variety of gorgeous widgets: weekly calendar, monthly calendar, last 3 months calendar, last 20 weeks grid, etc.\n\n• Share Your Habits\nShare your habits with friends, family, and followers - thanks to the beautifully designed,  pre-formatted calendar images.\n\n• Get Your Dopamine Rush\nNothing quite hits like the dopamine rush you get when crossing off an item on a list. With Evoday, you can track your daily goals and feel that sweet sense of accomplishment when you reach them.\n\n• Your Data Is Your Data\nWe care about your privacy.

If you go into just about any therapist or psychiatrist, CBT will likely be one of the first treatments they try.\n\n\nFreeCBT is a companion and self-help app for one of the most common formats of CBT. You may have heard it called \the three column technique\ or \catch it, check it, change it.\ Your brain is really good at making you feel exactly what you're thinking. Often, we find ourselves thinking \automatic negative thoughts\ that lead us to fume on something that may not be true. That can cause us to feel depressed or anxious.\n\n\nCBT helps you record \automatic thoughts,\ challenge them with cognitive distortions and then train your brain with an alternative thought.

Be guided by Drs Chris Irons and Elaine Beaumont – leading authorities on self-compassion, who collectively have 40+ years of experience as therapists and have helped tens of thousands of people.\n\nThis app has undergone a nationwide study, with participants showing significant reductions in stress, anxiety, self criticism, and increases in wellbeing. Anyone can develop self-compassion and enjoy all its benefits – we look forward to showing you how.\n\nWhy self-compassion?\nWe are often our own harshest critic, talking to ourselves in ways that we would never do our close friends. Given that we spend more time with ourselves than anyone else, isn’t it strange that many of us don’t treat ourselves with the same level of kindness, care and support as we do our close friends? Now is your time to start.\n\nWith evidence based ideas and exercises from CFT, this app will teach you how to cultivate compassion for yourself and others. Through the course, you’ll learn how to strike a balance between self improvement & self acceptance: teaching you how to have a realistic but kind view of difficulties that arise in life, and giving you the confidence you need to achieve your goals in life, work and relationships.\nA toolkit for managing the ups and downs of life.\n\nReduce anxiety, stress & depression\nImprove mood & wellbeing\nReduce feelings of shame & low self-esteem\nBetter understand yourself\nIncrease your confidence\nImprove your productivity\nAppreciate the good in every day\nDevelop your relationships\nFeel calm & grounded\nBe kinder to yourself\nAnd more...\n\nThere’s something for everyone:\nVisual breathing tools to bring you back to the present\nSleep stories & meditations\nHIIT and yoga videos to get you moving\nMindfulness audio guides\nCutting-edge tools to measure & improve your heart rate variability\nJournaling to create habits of positivity\nStep-by-step reflective exercises to help you manage difficult emotions\nSurveys to measure your progress\nAnd more!\n\nAbout Chris Irons & Elaine Beaumont\nDr Chris Irons and Dr Elaine Beaumont are leading therapists and researchers in the field of CFT and compassionate mind training. They have written extensively about the topic, publishing the best seller The Compassionate Mind Workbook: A Step by Step Guide to Cultivating your Compassionate self.\n\nJoin our community\nWe’re so excited to see you all loving the app – we’re passionate about the benefits of self-compassion\nand feel very lucky to be able to share the joys of it with others.\n\nWe know how tricky it can be on your own to turn advice into action. That’s why we’ve created this app – to guide you into applying the best insights from CFT to your own life in daily, actionable steps so that you can create meaningful change. We know therapy isn’t an option for everyone – our mission is to create an app that is more effective than a book, and more accessible than therapy.\n\nTerms of use\nhttps://www.psyt.co.uk/terms-and-conditions/","2023-06-04","2025-05-27","2025-05-27","4","4","0","4","4","0","0","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Offline, Own Your Own Data","Psychoeducation, Journaling, Deep Breathing, Productivity, Track Mood","Surveys, Diary, Social Network","Notifications, References/Information, Reminders, Summary of Data, Link to Formal Care/Coaching","Stress & Anxiety, Mood Disorders","Has Privacy Policy, Can Opt Out of Data Collection, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Can Delete Data, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Data Stored on Server, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help, Kids Help Phone Approved","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Appropriately Advises Patient in Case of Emergency","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Assessments/Screenings, Videos, Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/gh/app/the-self-compassion-app/id1553464180","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.psyt.compassion&hl=en_US&gl=US","https://balancedminds.com/the-self-compassion-app/","kaitlynr@bu.edu","shreya.sharma@kidshelpphone.ca","1685910605250","1748374539867"

Created for teenage mental health charity stem4 by Dr Krause, a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, in collaboration with young people, the app uses principles from the evidence-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for eating disorders (CBT-E).\n\nLike all stem4's award winning apps, it is free, private, anonymous, and safe.\n\nThe app provides a range of helpful activities and information, based on the notion that through learning to challenge and change thoughts, emotions, behaviours, and body image issues underlying low self-worth, eating and body related issues can be helped.\n\nBy identifying these underlying factors, and monitoring them over time, you can also start to identify what your triggers and maintaining factors are and work towards making positive change.\n\nThe ‘Change the Story’ section of the app helps identify negative self thought and learn how to substitute positive self-thoughts. ‘Change the Action’ focuses on identifying negative behaviours and altering them. In ‘Change the Emotion’ users are provided with alternative, self soothing behaviours to manipulate their eating and in ‘Change the way I view my Body’ users are taught how to separate fact from assumption.\n\nThere is also a range of information within the app for users to learn more about eating disorders, such as the importance of regular eating and hunger, the health consequences of eating-related behaviours, and issues that maintain eating disorders. \n\nThe app also allows users to build a ‘safety net’ of helpful thoughts, behaviours and people to contact, and signposts to help. Finally, users can monitor and keep track of which app activities help, record thoughts and feelings in a journal, and view daily motivators.\n\nWe understand the importance of privacy and so no identifiable data is collected in the app and no WIFI access or data is required.\n\nIt is built to NHS standards.\n\nPlease note that the Worth Warrior app is an aid in treatment but does not replace it.\n\nWorth Warrior is the latest app in stem4’s digital portfolio of apps that use evidence-based principles to help young people manage the symptoms of mental health difficulties and disorders. As of June 2022, stem4’s existing apps (Calm Harm, Clear Fear, Combined Minds and Move Mood) have been downloaded over 3.25 million times, and have received various awards including:\n\n- The Digital Leaders 100 Awards ‘Tech for Good Initiative of the Year’ in 2020, for stem4’s full app portfolio\n\n- The Health Tech Awards Winner ‘Best Healthcare App of the Year’ in 2021, for Calm Harm\n\n- The CogX Awards Winner in ‘Good Health and Well-Being’ in 2020, for Clear Fear","2023-05-10","2025-05-27","2025-05-27","7","7","1","6","6","1","0","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, Totally Free","Offline","Psychoeducation, Journaling, Picture Gallery/Hope Board, Goal Setting/Habits, Productivity","Surveys, Diary","References/Information, Summary of Data","Eating Disorders","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Can Opt Out of Data Collection","Self Help, Reference, Kids Help Phone Approved","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Use Warning","Non-Profit Company","User Generated Data","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/worth-warrior-help-body-image/id1641866414","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.org.stem4.worthwarrior","https://www.worthwarrior.co.uk/","tolear01@tufts.edu","mayu.yoshikawa@tufts.edu","1683740970785","1748315486672"

MST IS a simple set of tools that make it convenient and easy for you and other members of AA / Alcoholics Anonymous work steps 10 and 11 on a daily basis to keep you from relapsing back into active alcoholism.\n\n12 Step Toolkit AA Steps App - that is helping over 100,000 members of Alcoholics Anonymous get their daily reprieve from alcoholism and maintain their spiritual condition.  \n\nWe are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. This app helps US maintain THAT spiritual condition.\n\nResentment is the number one offender.  Now you can get rid of your resentments fast while on the go with the Spot Check Inventory tool that’s mentioned in Step 10 of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions Book to help with our daily ups and downs, especially those where people or new events throw us off balance and tempt us to make mistakes.\n\nDo you do a Nightly Inventory as suggested in Step 11 of the Big Book before retiring each night?   You should and now It’s EASY!  With MST just answer 10 simple questions straight from the Big Book and you’re done!  \n\n* Read the AA Daily Reflections Fast!  Quickly get your daily reflection for the day direct from the Alcoholics Anonymous website.\n\n* We are only as sick as our secrets and the alcoholics anonymous recovery program is all about sharing with others, particularly our sponsors.  So My Spiritual Toolkit has a super feature for sharing your inventories, journal and gratitude lists with your sponsor or trusted adviser.  Simply Text or Email your sponsor right from within the app and get feedback fast!\n\n* The spot check inventory tool is similar to a mini step 4 inventory. You can create different inventories based on the big book style - resentment, fear, sex and harms done. \n\n* This 12 Step App has a sobriety calculator which keeps track of the number of days you are sober for. Just set your sobriety date on the counter and it will automatically calculate how many days you’ve been sober, years sober, months sober, even hours!  Even more fun, you can share this with your sponsor or other trusted advisers from right within the App!\n\n* You also have an Online Journal you can use to clear your head of unwanted racing thoughts and irrational fears before you fall asleep at night. Get those crazy thoughts out of your head and into your journal!  Plus you will be able to read old journal entries to see how far you've come.\n\n* Gratitude List - Your recovery program is not complete without the gratitude list tool. This pro tool will take your sobriety to the next level.\n\n* PIN locking will keep your info safe and secure for your eyes only.\n\n* Do you prefer to type on a computer? You can use the accompanying My Spiritual Toolkit Web app from any browser for free!  No other app offers this feature!\n\nPrayers included:\n- Serenity Prayer\n- Big Book Third Step Prayer and Seventh Step Prayer\n\nThe Spot Check Inventory (think mini 4th step) allows you to quickly get rid of resentments when on the go and you can later add more detail via your computer because all data is encrypted and securely synced to the web app!\n\nJust because you’re a recovering alcoholic doesn't mean life will slow down. Instead it will move forward, and so must you. Oftentimes moving forward means being on the constant go. In effect, this means that if you’re using journaling as part of your recovery from alcoholism, then you don’t have time to sit down and write your feelings out.\n\n- To protect anonymity, the app icon does not show AA references.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttps://www.myspiritualtoolkit.com/privacy-policy/","2022-05-19","2025-05-26","2025-05-26","12","12","2","10","10","2","0","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription, Payment","Accessibility, Email or Export Your Data","Journaling, Goal Setting/Habits, Track Symptoms, Track Mood","Diary, Surveys","Summary of Data, References/Information, Reminders, Notifications","Substance Use (Alcohol)","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared, App Reports Security Measures in Place","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data, Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/12-step-toolkit-aa-spiritual/id642922942","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myspiritualtoolkit.mytoolkit&hl=en_US&gl=US","https://www.myspiritualtoolkit.com/","wooseok.kwon@vanderbilt.edu","sdl182201@gmail.com","1652932718992","1748227383496"

Relay gives you a clear, structured path to help you rewire your brain and actually solve the underlying problems that have kept you stuck — not just put a band-aid on it like internet blockers do (sorry, Covenant Eyes).\n\nWHY RELAY IS UNIQUE\nDeveloped together with licensed therapists who have 40+ years of combined addiction expertise, Relay's program provides interactive video lessons, a private accountability group, and variety of psychology-based tools to help you slow down the addictive cycle and replace it with a healthy system for renewal and fulfilled living. \n\nWe start by helping you craft a personalized plan for your unique situation, which we'll review with you in a 15-minute phone call during Week 1. \n\nThe more you check-in and record your data, the better able Relay is to surface patterns and help you make intelligent adjustments to be more successful.\n\nThe biggest reason people choose Relay is for the tight-knit group format. Within your team, you can stay anonymous to protect your confidentiality while still gaining access to true connection and shame-free accountability. All communication happens via secure group chat in the app, but you can also join live meetings via Zoom if you want to go deeper (hint — most people LOVE the live meetings despite feeling nervous to jump in at first).\n\nIn summary, Relay's program is great for people who want a deeper, comprehensive approach that includes therapist-created lessons, group-based accountability, and personalized feedback. It's a human-centric approach to recovery.\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\n-> \This program has changed my life in 6 months.\ - Matthew\n\n-> \You cannot put a price tag on this platform. What you get out of it pays for itself.\ - Bryan\n\n-> \Relay has provided a source of constant encouragement and sense of community that no other program I've seen can do!\ - James\n\nPRICING\nOur mission is to build a platform that is 10x easier and more effective than anything else out there.\n\nWe are a very small team with limited funding, and we're doing our best to stay afloat with the current economy. By charging a reasonable fee, it allows us to support the costs of enlisting a world-class team of psychologists and technical folks needed to continue to expand the program resources. Please check out all of our reviews below if you want to hear from real customers about why Relay has been worth it for them.\n\nTo make the investment zero risk, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee: if you don’t find the program helpful to you after 30 days, we'll help you obtain a refund. Additionally, we never want cost to be the barrier for anyone serious about getting help, so we offer limited scholarships to help provide access to people who truly can't afford the cost.\n\nEmail support@joinrelay.app if you're in this situation and we'll do our best to help.\n\nFor questions, email support@joinrelay.app\n\nPrivacy policy: https://www.joinrelay.app/privacy-policy\n\nTerms of use: https://www.joinrelay.app/terms-of-use\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nRelay is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Just as thousands of people succeed daily, you can also tread this path to success. We are here to help you quit smoking, without pressure, and respecting your own pace.\n\nIsmokay was conceived with the mission to assist you in quitting smoking and to be by your side on the path to freedom from smoking. It symbolizes the convergence of experts in various fields:\n\n• Cardiology\n• Psychology\n• Nutrition\n• Spirituality\n• Yoga\n• Physical education\n\nTogether, we form a team ready to help you quit smoking.\n\nOur approach is based on science and facts, and although we may sometimes sound too direct, it's because we are committed to raising awareness about the negative effects of smoking. But rest assured, here, messages of hope, reflection, and motivation prevail, where we will show you how it's possible to reprogram your mind to embrace a full and free life.\n\nHere at Ismokay, you have access to various features designed to support you in quitting smoking and promoting your personal transformation.\n\n• CHALLENGES\nWithin Ismokay, you will benefit from a series of challenges that span over 7 days, covering meditation and prayer, mental training, balanced nutrition, self-awareness of your habits, and a variety of physical activities aimed at strengthening your body and mind.\n\n• BEHAVIORAL EXCHANGES\nThe essence of change lies in replacing harmful habits with healthy practices, preparing you for a future of vibrant health. We provide a space for you to choose which new habits you want to incorporate into your routine. You will not only free yourself from the bonds of smoking but also elevate your quality of life.\n\n• MARK THE DATE TO QUIT SMOKING\nCommit to your freedom by marking the day when you will definitively leave tobacco behind. For 7 days, you will be on an effective path to quit smoking. In the days leading up to the milestone of your freedom, we will provide you with content that will empower you to achieve and maintain this achievement in a planned and lasting way.\n\n• DAILY LETTERS\nEvery morning, we will present you with reflections and comprehensive content, touching on various aspects of your life and well-being. Our purpose goes beyond combating smoking; we aspire to promote a revolution in your approach to life, allowing you to live more fully and meaningfully.\n\n• MESSENGER, MEDIA CENTER, AND NOTICEBOARD\nHere, we have created a space for learning and reflection. Record your insights and emotions throughout your journey. Explore meditations, prayers, reflections, and technical content that will challenge your mind and provide the necessary encouragement during the most challenging moments on the path to quitting smoking.\n\n• CONSUMPTION CHART\nSet goals for gradually reducing your weekly cigarette consumption, adjusting the quantities until you reach zero consumption. This initial milestone symbolizes your transition to a life full of health and quality of life.\n\nNow it's up to you. We understand that it's a challenging journey, and you may not have succeeded in previous attempts. Remember, your past experiences do not determine your future.

As long as you keep your habits, you will grow a garden and fill it with flowers! It is designed to be a relaxing, non-stressful app that encourages you to make small steps everyday and progress at your own pace.\n\n\n==============\nHow does it work?\n==============\n\n◆ Create your daily habits, tasks or goals you wish to achieve every day.\n◆ Each day, if you mark them all as achieved, a plant will flower, step by step.\n◆ However, if you don’t achieve your tasks, a part of the flower will fade away.\n◆ Each day, your tasks are automatically refreshed (to do again).\n◆ As long as you take care of you, you will take care of your garden.\n\n\n==============\nWhat else?\n==============\n\n◆ A simple, clean, minimalist design.\n◆ Very simple to use.\n◆ Reminder and timer to help you focus.\n◆ Widget to put your garden on your home screen.\n◆ No fancy graphics or complex statistics.

With the right habits, it is quite simple (but never easy) to bring balance, harmony, satisfaction and discipline in our life.\nHabits are not only things we do with our hands and feet, but also our mind: what we think about, how often we express gratitude or make compliments.\nWith this in mind, we wish you a happy life, and if our app helped you along the way, stop by to say \Hello\. :)\n\n***\nIf you have any question, suggestion or feedback, please email us at hello@millefeuille.agency.

In the early 2000s, at the intersection of digital technologies and psychology, a new technique ”computerized hypnotic sessions” emerged. Unlike the classical approach, the hypnosis sessions have a wider arsenal of methods of altering consciousness.   \n\nA hypnosis session is a program which contains visual imagery (spirals or circles of a certain color rotating and pulsating at a given frequency) and a soundtrack which influences the subconscious according to the theme of the session selected. Due to simultaneous use of subliminal suggestions and neurowave stimulation, a session helps a person to overcome psychological, physical and emotional barriers. \n\nIn addition to individual peculiarities of the conscious, all people have common mechanisms of psychic activity (inborn reflexes, basic instincts, frequency response); this is exactly what hypnotic sessions deal with. Now it is possible in a few weeks to achieve the effect that took the analysts months and years before. You don’t have to go to a qualified hypnotherapist as you can achieve the effect in a comfortable environment, without leaving your house. \n\nThe following hypnosis sessions are available for the “Hypnomatic” users: \n* Weight Control \n* Quit Smoking \n* Money Orientation \n* Health\n* Desires \n* Focusing on Studies \n* Lucid Dreaming\n* Self Confidence\n* Analytical Ability\n* Sexual Confidence\n* Sports \n* Freedom \n* Tussle with Insomnia \n* Big City \n* My Reality \n* Fear of Flying\n* Knowledge \n* Biorhythm \n* Happiness \n* Overcoming Fears \n* Jealousy Reduction \n* Relaxation \n* Nail Biting Habit \n* Stopping the Internal Dialogue \n* A Big Day \n* The Fear of Making Acquaintances \n* Yoga \n* Wit \n* Creativity\n* Alertness while driving\n* Painful breakup\n* Hangover aid\n* Learning languages\n* Energy recovery\n\nEach hypnosis session includes an instruction. Misuse or use of sessions more frequently may lead to negative consequences. It is possible to use several programs at the same time. Moreover, it is not recommended to use hypnosis sessions while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or if a person suffers from paranoia, schizophrenia, psychosis psychotic disorder, epilepsy or arrhythmia. \n\nYou have to understand that the issue is not a mystical healing as if touched with a magic wand, but a specific and purposeful work on the side of a client. A hypnotherapist or a hypnosis session facilitates an input into this powerful state of the brain, but the result depends primarily on a client’s desire and will.\n\nPrivacy policy: http://hypnomatic.uk/privacy_policy.pdf\nEULA: http://hypnomatic.uk/hypnomatic_terms.pdf","2021-07-12","2025-04-27","2025-04-27","13","13","1","12","12","1","0","iOS","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription, Payment","Spanish","Psychoeducation","","Notifications, References/Information","Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared","Reference, Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts, Videos","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hypnomatic-mobile-hypnosis/id516661501","","","miltontnguyen@gmail.com","kparkher@bu.edu","1626065886695","1745793811193"

To help you, Parazute deploys support from your network when your mental status negatively changes. Early support - even with minor changes in mental status can prevent hospitalization, self-damage, or even more unnecessary fatal tragedies.\n\nParazute can be used for all mental disorders where support from the social network is sometimes needed to move forward, such as ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline, dementia, depression, addiction disorders, OCD, PTSD, psychoses, self-harm, schizophrenia, eating disorders, stress, etc.\n\nWITH PARAZUTE, RELATIVES MAY STAY CALM\n\nAs relatives, there’s a lot of stress and anxiety at stake every day, and you’re desperately trying to help your loved ones. With Parazute, you’ll be notified should a mentally ill friend or a family member need your support. \n\nHOW PARAZUTE WORKS\n\nThe Parazute app reports the mental health status to the network based on a few daily inputs. It is less than one minute of effort for the patient. In case of adverse development in mental status – the self-selected “Parazuters” made up of family, friends, and even caregivers that the patient already trust today, get notified that the patient need some love.\n\nParazute cannot diagnose mental illnesses nor assess the relative level of a given mental state, for example, severe, moderate, or mild depression.\n\nParazute is also not a treatment but only early detection of a change in mental state and then activation of support from the network.\n\nIn case of indication of self-harm, always seek help actively.\n\nParazute is developed by patients, relatives, and mental healthcare professionals in close collaboration with the Danish National Association for Mental Health.\n\n \nOUR SOCIAL COMMITMENT IS MORE THAN JUST WORDS\n\nParazute has been built from the ground up in a true co-creation spirit. Every employee at Parazute has hands-on experience within the mental illness field, whether it’s being a patient, a relative, or a healthcare professional – simply put, it’s a job requirement.\n\nWe’re committed to donating 30% of our monthly basis fees directly towards scientific research to actively help the study of digital psychiatry and the emotional well-being of relatives.\n\nWe'd love to hear about your Parazute experience: Reach out to us if you have any feedback or questions: E-mail - info@parazute.com\n \nPARAZUTE SUBSCRIPTION\n\nUnlock full access to your mental health insights with Parazute.\n \n• Access all of your historical data, and see your development over time.\n• Download your mental status over time to bring to your healthcare professional.\n\nParazute offers auto-renewing subscription:\n \n• $14.99 billed annually\n \nFor more information, see our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy: \nhttps://parazute.com/terms/\nhttps://parazute.com/privacy-policy/\n \nThese prices are in US Dollars (USD).

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, improving rest quality helps the body better regulate everything from digestion to cognitive performance.\n\nOur users reported having a better mood and lower stress levels, anxiety & adhd relief that allowed them to sleep better throughout the night.\n\nThe popular sleep app on iOS is now available on Android!\n\n“...sleep music, guided meditations, breathing exercises and audio stories deploying soothing soundscapes…” - The Washington Post\n\n😴Our Sleep App Features:\n\n★ Large audio library of sleep meditations, sleep stories, bedtime stories for adults and kids\n★ Guided sleep meditations and relaxing  sleep sounds utilize mindfulness, gratitude, and suggestive hypnosis to help you  fall asleep and relax\n★ Mix feature - customizable night music and soothing sleep sounds allow you to create the perfect sleep ambiance for anxiety, ADHD & stress relief\n★ Handpicked collections of audio sleep stories and relaxing sounds by topic - like sleep sounds, lullabies for babies, or classic fairy tales\n★ Original bedtime stories for adults & kids crafted by Slumber Studios team\n\nCheck out what our users have to say:\n★★★★★  Slumber is Better for sleep than the Calm app\nI bought Slumber & Calm at the same time. When I want help sleeping, I find myself turning to Slumber only. Their narrators are more skilled in the relaxing & soothing style of speaking. You don't need celebrities; you need people with calming, wonderful voices who know how to read in a hypnotherapy-style cadence. And Slumber has better sleep sound options, and you have more control over those options. I also like that you can choose to keep playing the background noise, and perhaps a sound like rain, for a set amount of time after the narration ends. Also— better calm stories designed for relaxing, comforting sleep too! Plus, the price is better.\n\n-- Cafegirl2009, App Store Review\n\nCuring insomnia is not only about sounds to help you sleep. Sleeping meditation, audio bedtime stories, calming stories for sleep & other sleep aids can also help. Our goal is to help you get a good sleep at night. Our bedtime app does not provide sleep games that make you sleepy.","2021-06-16","2025-03-23","2025-03-23","15","15","4","11","11","4","0","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Offline, Own Your Own Data, Accessibility","Deep Breathing","External Devices","Notifications, Social Network","Sleep","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is PHI Shared, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Can Delete Data, Is De-Identified Data Shared","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slumber-fall-asleep-insomnia/id1109543953","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.slumber.sleep.meditation.stories&utm_source=slumber.fm&utm_campaign=home&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1","https://slumber.fm/","as5957@barnard.edu","selzzt@bu.edu","1623859849981","1742745053074"

Dependence can range from, avoiding life problems, and boredom to dealing with anxiety, and depression. If marijuana has caused a negative impact on your life, Grounded can help you quit smoking, vaping and transform your life. With our stop smoking trackers quitting smoking is easy, focused and mindful which gives better results to stop this health harming bad habit.\n\n✖️OR TAKE A SHORT BREAK\n\nWe also recognize that some users who would like to use Grounded are not life long ganja quitters but may just want to take a short break to increase their tolerance, or to flush the THC out of their system.

Grounded provides all the quit tracker tools and resources needed for all our 420 friends on all sides of the 420 spectra.

Use this super-simple to use diary to know which activities make you feel your absolute best and which ones might be negatively impacting you.\n\nWe recommend logging your mood at least once but preferably 2-3 times a day. You should at least log any drastic changes in your mood and factors which make you feel that way. \n\nChoose from a list of color coded moods and attach optional positive or negative emotions you might be feeling. Add activities on what you have been up to. Describe the weather if you like. You can also add photos and notes to the logs. \n\nMoodWell uses the recorded moods, activities and weather data to present interesting statistics on your mental health. The graphs and calendar show how your mood changes over a period of time. After logging a few times, you will get valuable insights like - which weekdays do you usually feel your best, which ones are the worst, which months of the year are your best and worst, which activities you do more often when you feel good and which ones make you feel not too good. Are you usually in a worse mood when it's cold and gloomy outside? Are you more energetic when it's sunny?\n\nThe color coded Year in Pixels chart shows you how you have felt on every single day throughout the year similar to an old school diary.\n\nThese insights will help you understand your mental health better. You can also use the search function to look for specific items - hastags can be used to make the search super powerful. For example:\n\n#n will search for all logs with notes\n#p will search for all logs with photos\n#awful will search for all logs with awful mood\n#exercise will search for all days when you worked out\n#sunny will search for all days when it was sunny\n\nMoodWell comes with:\n- No ads, No subscriptions and No analytics - data stays on your device privately\n- biometric (TouchID or FaceID) authentication to make your app private so only you can unlock it\n- ability to create custom activities, emotions, weather tags and rename and remove existing ones (PRO feature)\n- attach photos\n- attach notes \n- daily, weekly, monthly and yearly charts\n- reminders to never forgot to log\n- exporting to both CSV and JSON.

You can configure the charts for your needs. See everyday values, or view average values for a day, week or month. For example, if you have hypertension - do you know what is the cause and what is the effect. And what affects this the most?;\n✓ Track medications your cardiologist recommend and analyze their effectiveness. When you track blood pressure you can add a medication to the measurement and find out its effect. Did it help and should I take it longer, or the dosage is too high/low, or it even doesn't help at all?;\n✓ Notifications system - quickly and conveniently adjusted - now you will never forget to about the cardio journal. The most important thing in heart health is the consistency, stability, and regularity of data entry. By the way, you can also set notifications for the medications you take, and now you will never forget to do too;\n✓ Export the data and the charts from the cardio diary to the e-mail, text files or to .XLS and .PDF. Now you can easily present a picture of your health to your doctor;\n✓ Automatic data backup to the SD or the internal storage of the phone. Sometimes it is very important to have a long history of your BP changes for heart health, so you can be sure that all the data you add to the cardio diary are safe.\n\n💊 Diary of pulse rates and arterial blood pressure tracker (monitor) will be a great assistant for any person experiencing problems with heart diseases, who suffer from hypertension (increased BP) or hypertension (low BP) diseases.\n\n😃 What is TAG system? This is a lot of possibilities in your pocket - you can set tags before entering each tonometer readings - before dinner, after a sports activity, driving and etc. So, later, it will be very easy and effective due to log blood pressure to find out what factors and things make you suffer from high or low BP. Isn't it great to know?\n\nEveryone must know. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), the normal BP range is systolic 95 - 120 mmHg and diastolic 65 - 80 mmHg. But, every person has personal normal ranges. It depends on his lifestyle or health condition, for example for one person the systolic value of 130 mmHg could be normal, but for another person, this value can be extremely high. This data must be established by your health care provider. So, in the application blood pressure tracker, we use ranges system and everyone con set up if for himself. Be sure to find out your normal limits of systolic and diastolic BP.\n\n⚠️ Important: remember that to get your BP you must have a monitor (tonometer) on hand to enter the data in the cardio journal.  The blood pressure app is in no way capable of independently measuring pulse or BP(like any other).\n\nFor any questions, ideas, and suggestions, please write to our contact e-mail.","2023-01-10","2024-11-17","2024-11-17","6","6","0","6","6","0","0","Android","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Payment, Subscription","Email or Export Your Data, Offline, Spanish, Accessibility, Own Your Own Data","Track Medication, Track Mood, Track Symptoms, Journaling, Biodata, Identify New Conditions, Goal Setting/Habits","Surveys, Diary","Notifications, Reminders, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data","Cardiovascular Health","Has Privacy Policy, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Data Stored on Device, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Can Delete Data","Self Help, Hybrid","Well Written Relevant Content, Patient Facing, Does What it Claims, Use Warning","For Profit Company","User Generated Data","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=melstudio.mpresssure","","msingh10@bidmc.harvard.edu","yoelkys.morales@tufts.edu","1673378863882","1731882989819"

It detects and reports on trends of high blood pressure known as hypertension and low blood pressure periods known as hypotension.\n\n\nNext is a complete, and more detail, list of all the features the app supports: \n\n✔ It records your blood pressure measurements and categorizes them according to your BP range into high, low, or normal. \n\n✔ The app analyzes, on device (see our Privacy Policy), all your measurements, and generates several graphs and charts for you to analyze your blood pressure numbers. Furthermore, it computes advanced health markers like your pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, classification, trend, categories, and outlook.\n\n✔ Bloopy allows you to journal every detail about your measurements like systolic and diastolic pressure (in millimeters of mercury or mmHg), your pulse (in beats per minute or bpm), different tags like any arrhythmia detected by your blood pressure cuff, date and time, position (standing, lying, or seating), extremity (right/left wrist or arm) and any special notes you need to add.\n\n✔ Using the tag system, you can mark all readings taken by doctors allowing you to determine if your hypertension (HTN) is due to white coat syndrome, for instance. You can also record your high/low blood pressure symptoms, their possible causes, and pills taken. Moreover, you can mark cases of possible orthostatic hypotension (or postural hypotension as is also known) for later analysis of said symptoms and probable causes. There are no limits on how many BP tags you can create and/or assign to each measurement so you can be as specific as needed.\n\n✔ Bloopy has a powerful filtering mechanism to let you pinpoint specific reading(s) based on their blood pressure range, hypotension, hypertension, date, time, and tags. Using this tool, you can analyze measurements from a specific period, classification, or type. The best part is you can export all of that data and share it with your doctor, family, and friends at any moment without limitations.\n\n✔ You can also set reminders or alarms from within the app to help you remember to take pills, go to appointments with your doctor, or just to take a measurement with your sphygmomanometer. We recommend setting a daily alarm for this last task since constant information will improve the app's ability to compute health markers like your pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, average systolic and diastolic pressure, and pulse. This will make its predictions and analysis more accurate, especially when it comes to detecting high blood pressure (hypertension), prehypertension, low blood pressure (hypotension), and more.\n\n✔ Bloopy works with the most robust blood pressure guidelines in the world like the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, ACC / AHA; the Seventh Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, JNC7; the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology, ESH / ESC; Hypertension Canada, HC. You can switch between any of these guidelines at any moment depending on your needs, also you can let the app choose one for you based on your location.\n\n✔ It supports several profiles for different people, that way you can log different blood pressure readings, ranges, symptoms, and causes without interfering with each other. The app allows you to switch between profiles seamlessly and will show the appropriate information accordingly.\n\n✔ The app is constantly upgraded and improved to introduce new features, improve performance and fix bugs.","2023-01-10","2024-11-11","2024-11-11","8","7","0","7","7","1","1","Android","Free to Download, In-App Purchase, Subscription","Email or Export Your Data, Offline, Own Your Own Data","Track Symptoms, Journaling, Track Medication","Surveys, Diary","Notifications, Graphs of Data, Summary of Data, Reminders","Cardiovascular Health","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, App Reports Security Measures in Place, Is PHI Shared, Is De-Identified Data Shared, Is Anonymized/Aggregate Data Shared, Can Delete Data","Self Help","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing","For Profit Company","User Generated Data","","","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rodxander.bloodpressureapp&hl=en_US&gl=US","","msingh10@bidmc.harvard.edu","yoelkys.morales@tufts.edu","1673382493003","1731296940623"

Z O.O.","HeartScan is an AI-based app that helps you easily monitor your heart performance, from the comfort of your own home.\n\nThere is nothing more important to human health than the heart.\n\nSeismocardiography (SCG) is a technique of measuring the vibrations produced by the beating heart, where those vibrations are recorded from the chest. HeartScan app uses your smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope to record your SCG. After the recording, the app uses advanced mathematical algorithms to analyze your SCG and extract information about your heart.\n\nUsing the app is fast and easy. Simply lay flat on your back, otherwise known as the supine position, start the app, and place the phone on your chest. Wait 1 minute for the data to be collected and check the results right there onscreen.\n\nWhat does the app measure and present?\n\n• An SCG chart with all recorded cardiac cycles. A cardiac cycle is a full process from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. The length of time between successful heartbeats can vary by up to 20%, but if the differences are longer or erratic, you may need to investigate this further.\n• Heart rate. You can use the HeartScan app as a resting heart rate monitor, and get a very accurate measure of the heart rate. This is much more meticulous than pulsometer apps that rely on the phone's camera and finger for a pulse – HeartScan goes right to the \heart\ of the matter.\n• Length of each recorded cardiac cycle, which makes it possible to use the app as an hrv monitor.\n• Distribution of the lengths of all recorded cardiac cycles.\n• Combined cardiac cycle.\n• Clear signs of abnormalities that may need attention and further detection by a healthcare professional.\n\nYou can save your measurements and view them later using the history section of the app so you can track and monitor your progress over time.\n\nHeartScan also offers the ability to export your measurement results in a convenient PDF format. This feature enables easy sharing of your data with healthcare professionals and provides a flexible way to track your progress. Maintain a digital record of your heart health journey and access your important data whenever you need it.\n\nIMPORTANT:\nTHIS APPLICATION IS INTENDED TO BE USED BY ADULTS\nTHIS APPLICATION SHOULD NOT BE USED BY A PERSON WITH A PACEMAKER\nTHIS APPLICATION IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE AND IS NOT FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES\nPLEASE REMEMBER THAT THE HEARTSCAN APP IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR THE PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE OF A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL. ITS PURPOSE IS TO MAKE YOU MORE AWARE OF YOUR HEART HEALTH. THE HEARTSCAN APP CAN NOT BE USED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, MITIGATE OR PREVENT ANY HEART DISEASE, CONDITION, SYMPTOM, OR DISORDER, SUCH AS IRREGULAR HEART RHYTHM (ARRHYTHMIA), AFIB, ETC.

When I want help sleeping, I find myself turning to Slumber only. Their narrators are more skilled in the hypnotic, soothing style of speaking. You don't need celebrities; you need people with wonderful voices who know how to read in a hypnotherapy-style cadence. And Slumber has better sleep sound options, and you have more control over those options. I also like that you can choose to keep playing the background music, and perhaps a sound like rain, for a set amount of time after the narration ends. Also— better calm stories designed for relaxing, comforting sleep too! Plus, the price is better.\n\n-- Cafegirl2009, App Store Review\n\nCuring insomnia is not only about sounds to help you sleep.
