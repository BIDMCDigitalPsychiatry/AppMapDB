Daily affirmations help rewire our brains, build self-esteem, and change negative thought patterns. Empower yourself by verbally affirming your dreams and ambitions. Choose from many daily intentions and set reminders to be delivered throughout the day.\n\nPositive affirmations help make major shifts in your mindset, and they also serve as prompts and daily reminders about what you’re truly capable of, ensuring every day is an amazing day.\n\nAn affirmation is a simple but powerful statement that helps to strengthen the connection between your conscious and unconscious mind. The more you strengthen this connection, the more resilient you’ll be when you experience difficult or challenging circumstances.\n\nAs Buddha wisely said: you become what you believe. And the best way to strengthen your resilience is to practice affirmations every single day.\n\n\nThere are many benefits to using affirmations as part of your daily morning routine:\n\n- They help increase your awareness of your thoughts and words, making it easier to recognize the negative and self-doubting thought patterns holding you back.\n- Affirmations define your focus. When you focus your energy on the things you want, like achieving your goals, the positive, uplifting, and good, you’re creating an abundance mindset and strengthening your resolve to make it happen.\n- They open you up to possibility. Too often we get stuck in the ‘impossible’ mindset, but affirmations flip this on its head. When you begin to positively affirm what is actually possible, a whole world of opportunity opens up to you.\n\n*It works on Wear OS: you can use it on your watch.","2025-06-25","2025-06-25","1","1","1","0","0","false","Shows Unapproved Version","Android, iOS, Web","Free to Download, In-App Purchase","Accessibility, Offline","Goal Setting/Habits, Track Mood","Geolocation, External Devices","Notifications, Reminders","Non-Specific","Has Privacy Policy, Data Stored on Server, App Declares Data Use and Purpose, Is PHI Shared","Self Help, Kids Help Phone Approved","Well Written Relevant Content, Does What it Claims, Patient Facing, Supporting Studies","For Profit Company","Gamification (Points/Badges), Audio/Music/Scripts","","https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-am-daily-affirmations/id874656917","https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hrd.iam","https://theiam.app/","emilie.beauchamp@kidshelpphone.ca","emilie.beauchamp@kidshelpphone.ca","1750894461663","1750894461663"
